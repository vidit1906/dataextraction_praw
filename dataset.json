It's simply not feasible to scale a blockchain to accommodate everyone yet and the majority of other coins are utter pump and dump crap, at the moment the network throughput is 7tx/sec and coinbase alone is adding 100,000 users daily. The fee's are denominated in BTC and I've seen insane fee's during spam periods to get a tx on a block and this isn't an easily solved problem, the higher the BTC price goes the less likely your average person(or people from countries that actually need it) are going to be able to use it. The tech simply isn't ready (and I've been in bitcoin since 2011 precisely because of my lack of trust in big banks and spent years learning all the different aspects).\n\nI've had a lot of people recently get in touch who want to buy bitcoin (that I have literally been shouting at people to buy since it was $1.50 literally every time it cycles through a period of growth and bottoms out I tell people and they are were never interested), not because they see it as useful but because they see it as an investment.  Coworkers and family members that got bored of me talking about it are asking about it now they see it on the news hitting ATH after ATH they are interested, that's pure speculation. This is very reminiscent of 2013 but on a much larger scale which IMO will attract a lot of unwanted attention.\n\nYou should know the issues with a deflationary currency(I believe it's a good store of value) causing hoarding and a lack of investment and economic depressions so the dream of hyperbitcoinization really is far fetched IMO and noone has been able to tell me how a deflationary currency is going to work in practice. Bitcoin will eternally be in a bubble it always goes through the periods of growth but the market sentiment is incredibly fragile. The smallest bit of news and the market sentiment changes very quickly. \n\nI will not be surprised if it goes up 10x-100x from here but I think we'll be seeing suicide hotlines posted on this sub once again before long because too many people have literally no idea what they are getting themselves into (and I'm fairly certain it's not your average person market buying 2000 BTC at $8800 on GDAX or chewing at 100 BTC walls at ATHs) and have way over invested considering it's still a pretty young experiment. The growth will eventually slow, returns dwindle and the bears will appear and fear will take over. You don't have to look any further than this sub to see that so many people are obsessed with gains(in fiat) rather than the technology. People have bills/mortgages to pay and families to provide for so they wont all be looking to hold through an extended bear market."

Have Masters in Economics, this is something they teach you early on jn grad school.

They also were mostly immediately liquidating their bitcoin through a third party which put selling pressure on the market because they can't really keep something so volatile because businesses need stability. Japan is a very strange country economically. They have had a deflation issue for close to 3 decades which has crippled a lot of their economy. I imagine people will be happy enough to sell you real estate in a bullish market but in a bearish market no so much and bitcoin can't be a bull market forever because it would cripple investment in every other aspect of the economy because people will likely still hoard bitcoin because it's deflationary. The following if directly from the bitcoin wiki in regards to deflation.\n\n>The key difference is that people don't foresee a fixed cost (unit amount) that they must pay with Bitcoin. If the value of the Bitcoins that they own increases, then any future cost will take a proportionally smaller amount of Bitcoins. There isn't any fixed incentive to holding Bitcoin other than speculation. \n\nI think there are incentives other than speculation but they are few and far between for your average person."

Look at japan since the early 90s their economy has suffered a hell of a lot exactly for that reason. Its why deflation is actually a bad thing for a currencies. If no one is buying then there are no jobs and things dont get done. If investment doesnt happen then infrastructure doesnt get improved. Theres no(or much less) incentive to invest if its that much harder to get your initial investment back. Inflation encourages investment (not that i agree with a lot of monetary policies). The main issue is wages have stagnated so your getting less for the same amount of work, not so much inflation(unless your in a country like Venezuala)"

The fact that we've had businesses accept btc before and they pulled the option because of lack of interest suggests that this is only true for day to day. "

USD would fluctuate greatly based on what people were willing to pay at the moment.\n\nWith that being said, I think bitcoin fucked up in two ways - by limiting the supply and with the progression of halving the reward. The halving should stop at some point - i.e., when you get to the 64th halving, it should stay at that level, because we will always have an increasing population which means we will always have increasing demand. People will always make mistakes and lose coins. If the value never becomes slightly deflationary, people will always hesitate to spend it.\n\nAlso, I think the supply (halving) should have taken into account the rate of adoption. Naturally you're going to have exponential adoption at some point in it's lifecycle. There should be exponential supply to keep the value stable, otherwise you're just generating bubbles.\n\nNow, nothing is set in stone; if they were significant issues there is no reason the network can't change to accomodate the need."

But next week a buck might be 50,000 satoshi, or 300,000. Does the store need to change all it's signage to keep up? Did the Coke go up or down in price?

I do agree that rapid change in a currency is going to mess with a market, especially where you have sticky prices and fixed contracts (due to the prior expectations of a stable currency) but this is irrelevant to whether it's inflation or deflation. There are far more examples of runaway inflation causing issues than the other way around.\n\nAny argument that can be thought of against deflation on the technical/nuts-and-bolts level can be applied to inflation equally (and often times is more applicable to inflation) just by flipping the question."

    "body": "**Tulip mania**\n\nTulip mania, tulipmania, or tulipomania (Dutch names include: tulpenmanie, tulpomanie, tulpenwoede, tulpengekte and bollengekte) was a period in the Dutch Golden Age during which contract prices for some bulbs of the recently introduced and fashionable tulip reached extraordinarily high levels and then dramatically collapsed in February 1637. It is generally considered the first recorded speculative bubble (or economic bubble); although some researchers have noted that the Kipper- und Wipperzeit (literally Tipper and See-saw) episode in 1619\u20131622, a Europe-wide chain of debasement of the metal content of coins to fund warfare, featured mania-like similarities to a bubble. In many ways, the tulip mania was more of a hitherto unknown socio-economic phenomenon than a significant economic crisis (or financial crisis). And historically, it had no critical influence on the prosperity of the Dutch Republic, the world's leading economic and financial power in the 17th century.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28"

The developers didn't just forget to program stability in, you know? Its a function of economics.\n\nThe value of money is in its utility as a medium of *indirect exchange*...in other words, the value is in having a share of a vast network of trading partners. Money doesn't need to be edible or useful in industry or good for making fire...it just needs to be a token held by a lot of people, and be scarce, fungible, homogenous, verifiable, transportable, and durable; then it naturally becomes a valuable network good; a medium of indirect exchange, store of value, and unit of account.\n\nThe volatility is slowly-but-surely decreasing as the market cap and liquidity and range of uses increase.  It will continue to do this in an ugly, non-linear fashion, where bubbles and busts continue, as they have been, to be the number one force which broadens the user-base. \n\nWhile you all have just come in to this phenomenon in the last few months, and you come to impart your cynical wisdom to us *hapless* bitcoiners who just don't understand that this is all going to come crashing down...the rest of us have been here, buying and holding through 4 or 5 or 6 such cycles, exactly as is happening now (only this one is less volatile in terms of percentages than previous ones)...and we gleefully await picking up more cheap coins again, when this next correction comes.\n\nYou will not hear of us again for several years...all the while, smugly assuming you were right, and [bitcoin has died](https://99bitcoins.com/obituary-stats/). Then, out of the blue, bitcoin will be resurging to prices an order of magnitude higher than now.  \n\nI cannot tell you how many times I've had people who were hyper-skeptical about bitcoin come back to me later and tell me how wrong they were."

It is not necessarily true with bitcoin. Speculators can hold onto it forever and still be speculators. This is because they can buy something with the currency and their speculation is based on the worth of that currency increasing relative to the price of goods.\n\n>So a drop will most likely be huge.\n\nThis sounds like wishful thinking on the part of late investors. The price has been rising and dropping, but the trend is always rising. We have already hit many milestones that should have seen these speculators drop everything. I am sure many did, but many more are waiting. If a 5x increase in price didn't cause this massive end of world drop, what will exactly?\n\nYou see, by the time bitcoin hits its peak, the people who held on will have no incentive to drop at all. They will have bitcoins, and those bitcoins will be ubiquitous because that is only way bitcoin would have hit its peak. This means bitcoin will be an established currency by this time and the game is over.\n\nWhen do you expect all the speculators to drop? Try to answer that question. You will find that many people can keep small amounts of bitcoin in terms of what they think is small, and they will hold onto them, and hold onto them, because there will need to be a 100x price rise for them to really care. So they will all be holding, but then hey, bitcoin will be everywhere and useful.\n\nUltimately what gets bitcoin beyond all of this speculation and to success is its merit. It appears to be a much better form of currency then existing forms of currency."

Any criticism of bitcoin that can also be levied against gold is essentially a criticism against a \"store of value\" which is an asset that is basically a hedge against the traditional monetary system.\n\nOther criticisms of bitcoin are roundabout logic like: Bitcoin is too volatile to be useful. That's only true while it is growing and not successful. So you are assuming bitcoin won't be successful because it isn't currently successful.\n\nHaving a non confiscatable asset that can be sent in a borderless fashion to anywhere in the world with a multitude of versatile storage options and the programmatic aspect which brings layers of \"use cases\" on top of that is pretty hard to beat. It is simply better than gold at doing what gold does."

The price goes up because people think it will go up and so they buy more and hold it. Everyone is making money until there are no more suckers to pull in. It still has higher to go but it's not a sound long term investment. Too many volatile price swings. Once enough people get burned, it's days will be over. "

In the sense that it can already be used to buy a lot more stuff than gold in a real world situation, I\u2019d say it\u2019s better than gold.  And that\u2019s not even counting its other advantages - portability, anonymity, transferability, etc.  IMO, its market valuation should be at least gold\u2019s ($7.8 trillion) if not more.  \n\nIf and when Lightning Network is successfully implemented, I can see it eventually being a very useful form of travel currency and I would venture to guess that there will be widespread acceptance in places with high numbers of international tourists.  SE Asia would be prime.\n\nSmart contracts would then take Bitcoin to the next level.  This is the thing that most people haven\u2019t really wrapped their minds around.  Bitcoin is upgradeable.  Any limitations you think it has right now are not what it\u2019s stuck with.  In the early days, of the Internet, you could only send e-mail.  But that didn\u2019t mean the Internet wasn\u2019t capable of much much more."

I actually first heard of bitcoin in mid-2011 by way of Silk Road. Someone mentioned Tor in a random reddit IAMA thread and I had never heard of it before, so I started down the rabbit hole of reading about Tor, its primary uses, Silk Road, and then bitcoin. I downloaded Tor and checked out Silk Road out of curiosity, and I remember it seeming so surreal that all of those products were being openly sold, sellers had ratings just like on Amazon, etc. It seemed like I had stepped into the future in which we transitioned from a war on drugs to a harm reduction model. And right there in the corner of the Silk Road site was the current bitcoin exchange rate. I think at the time, it was around $15 but falling pretty quickly after the first ~$30 bubble popped."

It will be used every time you hear in the news that Paul Manafort had over $212M hiding in Russia; it will be used every time a corporation wants to move their overseas revenues back home domestically without paying 30% in taxes.  It would have been an ideal choice during the Nixon era programs to help receive money from the Saudis in secret in exchange for protection, had bitcoin existed then, and these types of programs are still happening around the world.\n\nThere are also very legitimate uses, happily operating within Uncle Sam's vision; Wall St loves bitcoin.  Particularly the commodities exchanges are really growing into it.  Even the banks, you'd think they'd shun bitcoin, on the contrary they have many analysts publicly pouring praise for it.  They are regularly brokering deals with huge amounts of money and paying big % transaction fees on them.  Bitcoin fees are cheap.\n\nThink about it; how else could you possibly send someone $100,000,000 in secret to anywhere on earth within 10 minutes, secure without fraud or theft during transit?  Have a guy board a plane with a briefcase full of money?  Wire it through different banks on the books?  Exchange your country's currency for theirs?\n\n\n\nBitcoin's primary use is just getting started, and in order to support this new niche, it needs to grow even further.\n\n"

You can have fiat  cash holdings, which,  has a rate of value deprecation of about 2% annually from the start date of \"saving\" (considered the optimal target amount of loss of stored value annual fro those that issue the the currency).  It's kinda better to go into debt over saving that currency, right? As the actual cost of said debt actually awards you a savings (assuming an annual interest rate owed on that debt amount is either equal, or greater than zero, but, less than actually realized amount of inflation over the set of time it takes you payback that loan).\n\nNow, there exists a competitor that currently awards you saving...  I guess what I'm saying is simply get a credit card with a very high credit limit and as close to zero for the APR that exists....  Seems like an easy method to make quick cash while remaining debt neutral, or, go into debt on the gamble but realize the real gain comes from having the potential to have an asset of value for retirement...

That money could've been used in exchange for Bitcoin. All throughout Bitcoin's history any time you made a purchase with US Dollars, it could have been going towards Bitcoin. There was an opportunity cost with each decision you made. Does that stop you from acquiring the things that you want? It might actually, but it will really get you to question the general tradeoffs of what is in your present valued interest. Throughout most of history we have had floating interest rates that allowed us to determine the opportunity cost of our money. This is why market pricing is so important. It sends us signals of how capital should be allocated. Growing up my parents could put money in a saving account and actually get a yield and return on their money. Now the young generation are essentially losing purchasing power any time they put it in a savings account. Governments and central banks around the world have destroyed their money system by keeping interest rates at essentially zero to where individuals have little opportunity for actual yield. Bitcoin is changing the system by getting people to really think in terms of opportunity cost again. There is a real tradeoff between savings and consumption. In time as liquidity in the system arises and usage grows, we will see a pricing system in Bitcoin where a market interest rate is determined. This will allow individuals to more freely determine how they should effectively allocate their capital and come to a better conclusion as to how they should use their money: on savings, or on consumption. We are liberating money and in return, liberating the individual. "

Given that the price of bitcoin has minimal effect on other currencies, I'm not sure that the conditions for a deflationary spiral are met. I think if anything it could be a good ol bubble that occurs whenever speculative price estimates are much larger than the underlying supply and demand functions dictate (i.e. when people are over confident in an assets inherent value).\n\nAlso, never confuse past results with future expectations, bitcoin prices today are dictated by what people expect from bitcoin in the future. If big news breaks today about something that will increase demand for bitcoin in 5 years, the price of bitcoin will reflect that news *today*. I don't know enough about bitcoin to speculate on the supply/demand but the generic ideas of finance still hold."

If they do not want to draw down, they would spend bitcoin and then immediately buy back the same amount from an exchange.\n\nThe other is that a deflationary spiral is sort of a myth. The most prominent products in today's economy - computer hardware, smart phones, electric cars etc - are prone to severe deflation, but their producers continue to earn record revenues year after year.\n"

Institutional investors - and I mean super wealthy multi generational wall street bosses - were FORCED to take refuge in bitcoin - something they were originally bent on destroying via a pump and dump. \n\nNow these guys have been in the currency bussiness for a very long time, but their main unit of wealth generation - interest from fractional reserve banking - is under serious threat due to Trumps america first policy. Starting a month ago with the Fed Chair Swap and (even bigger ) giant tax cut - Trump is basically saying to global finance if you want to play ball in MY house, (which is THE house - strongest economy in the world) youll have to play by MY rules.\n\nThis is a huge, huge threat to institutional investors, and while they havnt \"officially\" announced it, the global financial market entered retraction a month ago. This crash is going to fuck some countries up big time, but mostly developing economies. Ie Japan, USA, China, most of Europe are in the clear but man oh man is the brazil going to get ass blasted in the coming years... Theyve been floundering for decades and I really don't think they will be able to recognize and appropriately handle the HUGE pump and dump coming their way. From a global finance perspective - its akin to sacrificing one person to save a dozen...\n\nBut its just epic I could go on for days I would not be worried about it crashing below 10k indefinitely over the next 12 months. You will have growth above current interest rates. . "

(Edit: or [maybe IRC](http://bitcoinwhoswho.com/index/jercosinterview).)\n\n> No clue whether he still has the BTC.\n\n\"Q. What do you primarily use bitcoins for? Do you still control millions of dollars worth?\n\nA. Bitcoin as a currency is meant to be spent. Those 10,000 BTC made it back into the economy fairly quickly, around the time they were worth some $400. A ~10x ROI from simply trading in a different currency is quite good, even if that factor could have been higher had I held on to said currency longer. Naturally there will always be people hoarding coins, trying to get rich, and quite a few people did get quite rich, but they wouldn't have got that way without economic growth allowing it. To that extent my bitcoin holdings do usually measure in hundreds or thousands of USD, simply because I use them much as I would a checking account, to conduct business both online and offline when I have the opportunity. Notably the \"humble bundles\" and the attached store accepting bitcoins significantly bolstered my video game library.\"\n\n-- http://bitcoinwhoswho.com/index/jercosinterview\n"

If you trust your friend, it\u2019s ok to give them some satoshis *before* they buy the movie tickets you discussed. Really. \n\nCoinbase now has a track record, and people behind it, that make trusting them with smaller amounts a perfectly REASONABLE decision one could make. \n\nThese newcomers are talking about storing fractions of a bitcoin there. The correct answer at this phase of adoption is \u201cYES: go ahead and use coinbase\u2019s hosted wallet, then try their hosted vault service to learn more about security. Once you have at *least* 0.1 bitcoin you can *start* worrying that you \u201chave\u201d to control your keys. (Start with a trezor or ledger). \n\nUntil then, why discourage users from experimenting using reputable ecosystem contributors like coinbase to the full potential?\n\nWithout coinbase, bitcoin wouldn\u2019t even be worth what it is today. Ditto if every new user couldn\u2019t even start using bitcoin without leaning to do everything DIY from day 0. "

Ever.\n\nIf you're going to put any amount of money in crypto that you're not comfortable losing due to 'Not knowing how this works', look into getting a Ledger Nano S, learn how to use it properly, do a test recovery so you know how it works, and store your crypto there.\n\nThere's browser based plugins as well that can store your crypto, and they sort of work, but if you aren't 100% sure your machine is infection-free, I would get a piece of hardware with a secure enclave like the Ledger Nano S just so you don't have to worry about losing your money due to foolishness.\n\nA lot of people lost their early bitcoin due to foolishness.

BitCoin (and other crypto currencies) are at the moment full of speculators that are buying with the hopes of selling later at profit.\n\nThat's great, until it's not. BitCoin already had a number of \"corrections\" (rapid drops). Yes it's always regained ground, but it's not necessarily the same people people. IE, there are going to be people that bought high and sold low losing money.\n\nYes, you can buy BitCoin. And yes, it may go up in value and Horrah! profit. Just realise it might also go down in value at which point you need to either consider cutting your loses or holding out until it recovers.\n\nLastly like all crypto's there is that idea of \"it's only worth things whilst people give it value\". That's true of any currency, but typically a countries currency is a more \"real world\" item. If the entire population decided BitCoin is worth nothing, it would be.\n\nIf you're going to invest, only invest what you could in worst case scenario lose and be ok."

It is NEVER to late to invest. I literally just got 5% on $50 in the past 4 hours?  Not to mention all the other money I have invested. I'm making money each hour. Small amounts, but much more than the bank ever will pay. I made more money in one week of Bitcoin than I will all year from my savings."

    "body": "Oh sure, on the left side, you have the cash committed to buy, and how much bitcoin that could buy at the spot price in the middle (whatever it last sold for).\n\nSo from where the left and right meet, in the valley, the left side is the buyers.  The right hand side is the sellers.\n\nIf you see a vertical wall, what that is is a large amount of bitcoin that someone wants to sell at a specific price. The shape of that curve up and away to the right from the mid point represents the accumulated bitcoin in height, and going to the right what price in dollars they'll sell that. Walls there represent \"resistance\" to price rises. If the walls turn the buyers back, buyers start to lose hope of a breakout (and gains), and give up and either drop their buys or become sellers themselves.\n\nThe left side represents buyers. The height represents how much bitcoin, total, in USD value is trying to buy. The distance going back to the left is the specific price they want to buy at. Walls there on the buy side represent \"support\". \n\nBut buy and sell walls can flash, come and go, and on some exchanges the buy and sell walls can be invisible :/ (for big buyers or big sellers). So it's more of a fun game. You are watching the surface fight of buyers who ponied up cash and wired it into the exchange (which takes time) and sellers who transferred bitcoin from their wallets to the exchange to sell (which is easy to do in an hour at home 24/7). So the sellers have a slight advantage. This leap to $10k has taken a month to develop. It can take a shit load of time to get an account approved, get in KYC / AML paperwork, and get trading. Selling your bitcoin is so fast, that in my opinion there's always downwards pressure.\n\nNow smarter traders always keep some back in fiat for good buying opportunities, and never sell all their crypto or spend all their dollars. \n\nIf you are super interested in forex trading, which is similar, check out babypips.com and for bitcoin in particular /r/bitcoinmarkets"

Those active bulls are the ones testing the walls. The supporting bulls are there for cheap coins.\n\nSo yes, a huge sell wall normally causes bulls to lose steam. But if they see there are no further walls, they could have a breakout.\n\nIf the sellers, bears, sell - dump onto the market, they can crash through support walls and cause a break down."

Unlike with penny stocks or stocks the coin is bound to pure computation power as such you cannot give out just another penny stock paper if you feel like it.\n\nAlso cashing out is not as easy as you think it is. If a lot of people try cashing out the network will become slower as in almost coming to a halt since all transactions are executed by the miners and they don't have endless computation powers. Meaning they prefer those that pay higher fees until it gets to the point of them being ridiculous high and slow as well. Given that there are often limits in place of how much you can cash out per day/week/month will only make matters worse. \n\nAs such an headless mass panic will often be grind to an halt before it even begins. If it comes to exiting the crypto-market as a whole that is.\n\n2018 things will change a lot which will make it hardly predicitable. Speakingly futures for BTC (supposed to launch this december) and technology advancements regarding Off-Chain transactions for example the Lightning Network that takes Miners out of the equation when it comes to swap coins with the same cryptographically base like Bitcoin, LTC, VTC, GRC with minimal fees and way faster transactions.\n\nIn my opinion Crypto is no different than anything else. You cannot expect endless growth and staying ahead of the game by mindless holding (think Yahoo shares back in the dot-com-bubble where people expected for them to recover, which they never did).\n\nSome people never learn."

Its fine if you don't understand it or are afraid - a lot of people are risk adverse.\n\nTechnology is moving in many other ways. Clean energy. Automated manufacturing. Smartphones. Virtual Reality. None of those things are scams like cryptos are. All of those things have ***real world value***, unlike cryptocurrencies (unless you're a drug trafficker or money launderer, of course).\n\nI don't find it silly. History finds it silly.

I've moved across the world multiple times. I've been in bad breakups. I've spent money to live places where I got zero percent return on my investment and somehow, life has moved on, I live a happy, fulfilling life, and Cryptos are some of my investments.\n\nIf bitcoin fell to zero tomorrow, I would shrug my shoulders and move on with my life.\n\nLife is full of risks. If you want to invest in your 6% per year investment fund, go ahead. Like banks, they will always be there, willing to give you the minimum while they take the maximum.\n\nIt is the easy way. There is no shame in doing it, technically it makes sound financial sense.\n\nYou find it silly. That's fine, my parents find it silly. They do not understand technology, risk, or the environment of the world today. You sound like a similar person, likely an older risk averse person. Its possible you are younger and simply scared. Nothing really wrong with that, you just don't mesh well with people who are willing to get creative.\n\nNo one is reading this far down by now but I figured I'd try one more time - other people can invest in different things than you'd enjoy or support, and thats OK. No one wanted computers, or telephones, or a space shuttle, but people created them anyways and pushed innovation forward.\n\nVery few people understand the workings of a stock market, or an online marketplace like amazon, but they still exist and still operate, even though they are not physical things. \n\nThat's just the direction technology is moving. Its fine if you don't understand it or are afraid - a lot of people are risk adverse. \n\nHave a good one."

In the song is about prince [Baji Rao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baji_Rao_I#In_popular_culture).  \n\nThe [lyrics](http://www.bollynook.com/en/lyrics/17983/malhari/) are pretty analogous, including such hits as:\n\n*Let the drums beat, let the cymbals ring, let the songs of happiness be played.  \n*Look how the enemy has been defeated\n\n*This small flame has erupted into a huge fireball\n\n*Everyone here is lost in excitement\n\n*This victory of ours is so colorful and unique (clearly referring to our alt coin brothers #inclusion #hopeitsnottoosoon)"

    "body": "When you set up a wallet it will give you a \"seed\" which is just a list of 12 words. It's basically a password that lets you recover your wallet if anything happens to it. So just write down the seed and keep it somewhere safe, away from the wallet. A bank box or at your mom's house or something like that. It's not recommended to save it on your phone or computer because in case that gets hacked they can steal all of your coins. \n\nI just use a USB stick and make a copy of it - so I don't even have to use the seed if something happens to one of them. Of course I keep the seed just in case. But that's one of the great things about the blockchain - the info is out there and can always be accessed. But the actual coins can't be moved unless you have the wallet and password, or the seed. \n\nThere are fancy wallets like Trezor you can buy which have some other neat security features. But the built in security is already very good - so long as no one gets your wallet + password, or gets your seed. \n\nYou don't want to leave a lot of coins on the exchanges, though, because something could happen to the exchange. Or the exchange could steal them - that's what happened with Mt. Gox, the first big exchange. \n\nThere are also wallets online, like at blockchain.info. More secure than leaving them on an exchange because only you own the seed or private key (a private key is basically the same thing as a seed). Even if the site went down, you could recover the wallet. \n\nIt's all a bit daunting at first, but once you learn a few of the basics it gets really easy. Just do a little research before trying things. You can set up a wallet with no risk - it is empty until you send some coins to it. And you can send one cent worth of bitcoin to it to test it.  "

Never gunna forgive myself for that, but at least I finally learned some shit and invested a few weeks ago at 5000.  \n\nedit: To all the people DMing me and what not to learn about Bitcoin, I appreciate it but I don't have time to respond to everyone! \n\nThe easiest way for you to get some bitcoin for yourself is simply to download the app 'Coinbase' and you literally just buy as much as you want on your debit card. That's not the ideal way to purchase bitcoin, all you really need to do is read this website. \n\nhttps://howtobuybitcoin.io/\n\nIf you want to know the tech behind it, that'll take more reading and it'll never really make complete sense to you lol.\n\nedit 2: https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6a04mc/why_have_i_been_trading_on_coinbase_vs_gdax/\n\nedit 3: \n\nLet's say you wanted to buy and store a bitcoin - before I go on, it's important to stress **YOU CAN BUY FRACTIONS OF A BITCOIN**, it doesn't have to be a full 10k to start - your first step would be to setup a wallet. Search this subreddit to read their recommendations, there's even a [link](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Storing_bitcoins) on the sidebar for it. I personally use Electrum. If you google it, you'll probably be able to set it up pretty easily. From there, you'll have a bitcoin adress. It'll look something like this: \n dm me\n\nWith that adress, if you purchase any amount of BTC on a site like Coinbase(see above and use GDAX) you can then send your BTC to the adress that you'll see in your wallet to keep it safe."

As a currency, it's doing pretty well. High trade volume ($BILLIONS per day). $175 BIL market cap.\n\nBTC has no choice but to become more valuable since it's already 3/4 of the way through its theoretical maximum supply.\n\nA Satoshi is still worth under a penny, making Bitcoin fractions feasible for any kind of transaction, not just banking and investment transactions: https://99bitcoins.com/satoshi-usd-converter/\n\nI think there is a big bubble from the standpoint of your average consumer. I am waiting to see how serious investors react to BTC's price. The problem with seeing BTC as a bubble, even though I think it *should* be a bubble, is there is no reason to sell it.\n\nBut you can. It's pretty easy to. Plenty of people have made $100k's+ converting their BTC to USD. I have held a good number of BTC in the past, and I am telling you from experience, when you actually own it for a while as opposed to just looking at the hype charts, you just aren't super convinced by the need to convert to USD.\n\nI sold out of necessity. I needed the cash and my portfolio was small. If I had a larger portfolio, it's possible I may have gotten a car, a house or hired services with BTC at this point... but really, like many others, I would just hold.\n\nIf you invested in BTC even earlier this year, you'd be up so significantly that even a major, major crash in BTC's value would still most likely leave you up a significant amount. That's the scary part, though... Most people buying BTC are gambling, not investing. So there is a bubble. However, there's no telling if it will ever pop."

Plus credit card companies protect you more than the businesses (you spending money means they make more money from interchange). If you are ever charged for an item you did not receive you call your credit card company and issue a chargeback. At that point it\u2019s up to the business to show proof and if they don\u2019t you get your money back and they get hit with a chargeback. Too many chargebacks and you can be banned from ever accepting plastic at your business again. "

Just a month ago, Google declined a 25$ payment without giving me any specific reason and i kept on trying after 30 minutes as it suggested and that's 9$ I'll never see again lol. Worst part, I contacted them about it, they never replied. Needless to say i had the wrong billing address on file but ain't nobody got time for that lol. So i just choose btc over these hassles. If they don't care for it i got no choice but to give them my card and keep it there. "

I myself buy games from Microsoft store with bitcoins because my credit card doesn't work there and I'm not comfortable putting my credit card in there either. Now wall street is getting involved. The total number of bitcoins that can be mined is fixed. The more the demand, the higher the price hike. So the price hike definitely makes some sense.\n\nThat said, i agree with you. yes making btc your only investment would not be smart. And since it is unregulated market, keeping your btc in exchanges isn't either, for all you know they're going to get hacked and it'll be an inside job. Where there is a ton of people who is merely buying it out of speculation, and without knowing where bitcoin's value lies, bitcoin has massive potential to change the world economy. And people who believed in it has been greatly rewarded, and will probably continue to do the same. "

The fact that major innovations were unpredictable or laughed at doesn't mean we should just blindly believe anything is possible and ignore any possible implications of a change. \n\nBanking has existed since people started trading in currency. There is no currency that will remove the need for banks, since banks are a function of currency. There were banks when the currency was bronze coins, there were banks when currency was backed by the gold standard, and there continued to be banks after it was abolished. The only time there weren't banks was when people traded in cows and pigs. The entire western world is built upon the concept of credit, and you can't have credit without something to issue it. "

    "body": "Thanks, I'll check that out, but in the meantime I have a more core question. When you say cryptocurrency will replace banks, do you mean banks like the Federal Reserve or banks like Bank of America? Based on my limited understanding of blockchain technology, I can see how its implementation can result in drastic changes of the former, but I can't see the latter ever changing unless we stop using currency altogether. Bitcoin will not replace the need for financing, and as long as there's a need for financing, there will be institutions that pool money from depositors and then loan out a portion of it with interest. Both credit unions and banks do this, and both operate based on the fractional reserve concept. The only difference is credit unions are non-profits, which lets them have different priorities than banks. "

    "body": "Unfortunately, we don't know that. \"Room to grow\" isn't based on any measurable reality.\n\nBitcoin is growing because there are huge amounts of money being injected on the speculation that it will continue to grow, with no backing or regulation. The moment large investors, including foreign manipulators, calculate that they can withdraw to maximize their initial investment based on slowing growth, they will. That will trigger a cascade as others try to get out because, more so than other bubbles, this only exists because they're in it. As soon as those large players bail, this falls just as quickly as it grows.\n\nFor long-term investment or stable currency options, you don't want skyrocketing; stable, understood growth is key. This volatility can go both ways. Some people are going to become fabulously wealthy, including a small number of individuals who can cash out at the right time. Hopefully the losses can be spread out far enough to not impact the small fry."

You'd also need a fairly free source of power to stay competitive with all the other miners.\n\nDo don't mine, unless you feel like doing it for fun, you'll most likely lose money, it's far from free."

    "body": "Bitcoin transactions are processed on a distributed network. That means people will need to dedicate computer processing power to actually do the work.\n\nThe people who volunteer computer processing power to facilitate this are the miners. The actual processing of these transactions is the act of mining.\n\nEvery time a new set of transactions is processed, a small amount of new bitcoin is created and awarded to one of the miners or group of miners working on processing those transactions.\n\nSince there's increasing numbers of bitcoin, users and transactions, it's more and more work to process everything. Which means the workload vs reward is skewing increasingly further towards more work.\n\nIn the early days, it was entirely possible to earn quite a bit of bitcoin with your personal computer. Of course at the time bitcoin was almost worthless.\n\nToday it takes a massive amount of processing power to earn a reasonable amount of bitcoin. Profitable miners use entire farms of computers to be profitable.\n\nFor the average individual user it makes more sense to simply buy bitcoin with regular money."

Bitcoin is still in its early phases and it hasn't yet even come close to reaching mass adoption or institutional investment.\n\n2) Bitcoin is highly divisible. The price is never \"too high\" to invest your first $50 into it - a 200% increase is still 200%, no matter how much of a Bitcoin you've bought, and it is predicted to keep going.\n\n3) The best time to invest in Bitcoin was 7 years ago. The second best time is NOW.\n\nThere were people kicking themselves at $1000 that they missed the boat. These same people will be kicking themselves at $100,000.\n\nedit: [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/new_to_bitcoin) is probably your best bet for buying your first BTC, but DYOR (do your own research)"

You only see patterns in hindsight. That's why you understand the fundamentals of it, to invest in the tech and the potential.\n\nLots of great videos online explain Bitcoin, if you need pointers or have questions just ask anyone around here."

    "body": "Yes, you can exchange this for fiat/usd (subject to capital gains tax). If you want to avoid tax I would recommend purchasing goods like gold, cars or even a holiday. \n\nThink of it kind of like today's modern piggy bank. Most people are now realizing they can store their wealth there, transfer it anywhere across the world or p2p without bank interference. Mark Cuban, Sir Richard Branson and many more billionaires (with wallstreet coming up) are getting invested.\n\nThe value of this will most likely increase after a short dip, so if you want to make more money off of it, just cash out a small portion of it. The price of Bitcoin may double before Q2 2018 so it's up to you how much profits you want to take.\n\nAs mentioned, look into obtaining the coins safely and storing them securely like in a hardware wallet or paper wallet.\n\n"

No government or army supporting them, no trade deals made with them, no bonds, no stock exchanges, nothing.  Its ephemeral, can blink out of existence tomorrow and no one will give a shit or be impacted besides the fools who pissed away a legit currency buying them.  People are hyping it up and holding, might as well replace bitcoins for baseball cards or some shit for all the worth they have."

(people buy bitcoin to profit in the future not to use it as a means to make a payment)\n3) Rationalizing asset prices by increasingly weaker arguments, such as \"this time it's different\" or \"bitcoin has build in deflation.\"\n4) A high presence of marketing or media coverage related to the asset (SUPER KEY IN 2017 FOR CRYPTO/BITCOIN), even your mom knows what bitcoin is) \n5) incentives that place the consequences of bad behavior by one economic actor upon another (you mine a coin and trade it for a net increase in resources and the person who bought it will be stuck with the risk, sites that let you purchase mining power contracts)\n6) International trade imbalances ( a lot of the mining is in china/ low cost areas) "

    "body": "Bitcoin is magic internet money. It\u2019s the first cryptocurrency. Satoshi Nakamoto (who remains anonymous) invented it in 2009. It\u2019s open source and peer to peer. There is no CEO, President, or main office. There aren\u2019t huge servers storing users account information. To me, it has real value because it is scarce, it can be transferred quickly worldwide, it is divisible (you can send/receive/buy /sell fractions of a bitcoin) and it can be used to pay for goods and services. Adoption is increasing and some places that accept bitcoin include Overstock.com. Steam, and you can save money on Amazon buying using bitcoin and the purse.io wallet.\n\nFake coins are not possible. The network that verifies transactions would reject counterfeits. Bitcoins are \u201cmined\u201d by people with specialized  and expensive computer hardware. The rewards for mining get cut in half every 4 years until eventually 21 million bitcoins will exist. There cant ever  be more than that. So no, nobody can give anyone including themselves unlimited amounts.\n\nWhen you buy bitcoin, YOU get the money. You don\u2019t trust a 3rd party, if that\u2019s what you want to do. You can be your own bank, if you choose to. With a more secure than average wallet, no1 can stop you from accessing your funds. Bitcoins are stored in digital wallets. Some are more secure than others. Wallets generally go from hot storage (like money in your pocket) to cold storage (like in a vault). \n\nWallet providers that handle security for you are examples of 3rd parties in control of your bitcoin who grant you access to it. They could freeze your account for some reason and a host of reasons why not to trust your funds on exchanges long term. Coinbase.com is the most popular way to buy bitcoin. They make it really easy. They handle security for you though. Which is good because it\u2019s easy to get started but I wouldn\u2019t trust them or any exchange with my savings. If they got hacked, I doubt you would see a refund overnight or soon. It\u2019s all relative, but I do not keep more than $100 on Coinbase or any exchange. I ignore Coinbase\u2019s vault features, which still do not put you completely in control.\n\nIt\u2019s best to move practically all or all of your bitcoin to one or two of the wallets recommended on the official website once you acquire some from an exchange like Coinbase: [https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet). \n\nCheck out this animated 3 minute YouTube video as a basic introduction to bitcoin too, although some of the statistics are outdated: [bitcoin: all the facts ](https://youtu.be/X_hz7TyQ_bs)."

These are *massive* problems that need a solution and have for decades. Bitcoin's success isn't dependent on solving these problems but it does get us one step closer.\n\nTo re-iterate: the onerous KYC/AML regulations which only apply to you and me are not a failure of bitcoin. The strained and aging financial networks are not a failure of bitcoin. The digital pseudo security practices which are more about protecting financial industry interests than you are not a failure of bitcoin.\n\nWhat you need to ask yourself is why is your instinct to blame bitcoin for this stuff? All you need to do is turn around and look at all the faces of the people who are telling you to do that and start asking why they aren't working *with* the bitcoin community to resolve these issues."

It's tied to increasing numbers of people and even investment groups buying into the hype hoping to profit from the cycle.\n\nSooner or later that's going to reach it's apex, when people realise it stops rising, they'll start selling. And the selling will continue until there's a new equilibrium is reached. And that new equilibrium will be based on what people are willing to pay for bitcoin simply for the functionality it provides instead of the hope it'll keep inflating based on media hype.\n\nThat stabilized value determined by function will be a mere fraction of the value determined by hype and hot air. It's the very definition of a bubble. \n\nI'd be saying the exact opposite if bitcoin's meteoric rise was based on increasing number of people *using* bitcoin. But it's not. You don't see your fellow citizens starting to buy and pay with bitcoin left and right.\n\nMostly what you're seeing is parasitic hodlers inflating the price and telling themselves they're going to be the ones that cash out in time. They're the ones that are going to get dragged out when the whales decide it's time to cash out."

It blew past 10k because people are literally speculating on bitcoin hoping to get a good return percentage.\n\nSooner or later it's going to peak, the speculators are going to decide the risk is starting to outweigh the potential profit gain and sell.

The second BTC becomes a viable currency for goods outside the internet, no government treasury is going to let that happen. People are buying because they're seeing incredible spikes. I have never used any of my 100s of BTCs bought for anything legitimate.\n\nedit: i would like instead of downvotes, people told me what they could spend BTCs on besides drugs and a handful of businesses. i would love to actually know what to do with the 3k that I apparently have right now from leftover darknet transactions that have gone to my electrum wallet."

You need to buy groceries. Do you exchange and spend dollars or do you find food you can buy with bitcoin? How does the money flow? Everything has a value.-The food, the dollar, the bitcoin. But fiat value is solely based on supply and demand. And that demand is tied to the trust in the US government and federal reserve.  BTC value is based on the supply and demand but that is tied to proof (block chain).\n\nE-commerce is currently way better for cryptos because of the delay in transaction time but I see room in the market for any business including brick and mortar to accept BTC. If you own a business, what currency do you accept? Why not BTC? "

In that scene, he's comes back from a battle, victorious of course. That's why they're celebrating. Now what kind of king dances along with his soldiers?? Praise, gift them, sure. But no one dances along with the soldiers. That's life against the code of conduct. Also the lyrics accompanying the song are completely ridiculous."

    "body": "You're really underestimating the value of the technology and you don't recognize the disruptive potential it has. Let's say a software company creates an application, they control it and can decide who access it and who doesn't, their revenue comes feom granting clients access to its application and they can do that because they own it. The good part of owning the application is that they control it but this has a downside, since the company controls it they can't assure beyond all doubt that the application won't be modified or changed in some way, so the clients need to trust the company. What blockchain allows us to do is to create decentralised applications(dApps) which allows us to take the trusting part out of the equation, the users know without doubt that the rules of the game can't be changed. But this has a downside, you can only assure you can't modify it if you renounce control over it, and that's what happens when you upload a dApp to a blockchain you lose all control over it, even the control to decide who has and hasn't access to it. That's where cryptocurrencies become relevant, the way we have found to give the content creators an economic incentive to create these applications and give them up to the network is by creating a cryptocurrency embedded in its code that solves who has access to it and who doesn't."

After the price goes up, people are more likely to hop out fast during a correction to stop the loss. Bit coin will continue up for a while, but it\u2019s setting up for a historic, record breaking crash.  Volatility bitcoin\u2019s ultimate weakness and demise. Bitcoin may have the headlines, but Ripple may have a future, if crypto sticks around that is. Historically big bubble."

The people who are rich are those who invested a lot of money into it when it was cheap (or even a year ago, it was around 800 dollars) and watched it grow to 10K. So if you bought 10 whole bitcoins at 750$ or whatever it was at the beginning of the year, you\u2019d now have 100,000 dollars if you held onto it the whole time. "

For now, it's used mostly online, but debit style cards which convert to dollars at the register are already available in some places.\n\nAlso 2nd layer businesses are being built on the blockchain right now that will use bitcoin to secure anything imaginable in a trustless decentralized ledger system.  Think the deed to your house stored in the \"internet ledger\" spread across many computers, as opposed to a filing cabinet downtown.  It reduces fraud and is a system of consensus..  in short, it's going to re-shape the way we interact with finances/documents and a range of other things.\n\nIt also is being used to invest in startup companies, called an ICO (initial coin offering).  Most are scams, but some will be your next Amazon's and Googles.  It's the new age of venture capitalism as these tokens (or shares) are purchased using bitcoin.\n\nIt's amazing being able to be in control of your own bank account that you can access 24/7, that cannot be taken from you, cannot be restricted from transacting.  It's financial sovereignty.  You are directly responsible for your money.  You are your own central bank. \n\n\nEarly adopters are the beneficiaries.

    "body": "Fuck yeah! Been following cryptos since btc was 180ish.  I checked my wallet today for various transactions I\u2019ve made in the past, and it was around 25.  Fucking mind blowing using a currency this volatile with deflation at this scale.  I still think it is a totally viable option for a currency, but btc leads the way and is a very different beast than the others.  I think it isn\u2019t going away any time soon.\n\nSide note to any new crypto enthusiasts: investment is only meaningful on a percentage level.  ETH and LTC are both surging at higher percentages than btc.    If the high barrier of entry to btc is intimidating, look into others and how they\u2019re different.  There are hundreds. \n\nWhat a huge milestone!!!!  Please don\u2019t eat your testicle guy who said he would at 10k.  \n\n"

I\u2019ve started to flip in the opposite direction now and become concerned about the price rise\n\nNow don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m a massive fan of BTC and it\u2019s capabilities in the long term so still invested obviously  \n\nBut recently there\u2019s been a few things that have raised my suspicions... \n\n- colleagues and others buying in without having a clue what it is but simply because they\u2019ve seen the news that it\u2019s increasing. Supply and demand is artificially inflating the price of a piece of tech that just isn\u2019t read for mainstream adoption... or worth 10k right now imo \n\n- the whole BitcoinCash political bullshit atm. Realistically, the \u201cowners\u201d of Cash are also heavily invested in BTC (likely still continually buying) and could easily rip their cash out causing huge panic and a price crash - which would also give a poor reflection of the BTC brand \n\n- rumours flying round the last few weeks that it was Cash owners spamming the network with transactions that led to the 100k mem pool build up also plays into potential attacks on the network - unlikely to be their only play \n\nI don\u2019t know if it\u2019ll happen anytime soon but the bubble it\u2019s recently got into is gonna pop at some point \ud83d\ude15 \n\nReally curious to hear other people\u2019s thoughts though and I could be way off but I trust my instincts and at the moment they\u2019re saying be cautious and ready for anything"

In common parlance, we call this unit the \"satoshi\".\n\nOne satoshi is currently valued at around one one-hundredth of a cent.  That is, 1 cent will get you 100 satoshi.  I'd call that pretty damned affordable by anyone really.\n\n> so even if it someday replaces paper money we will still be in the same situation and bits will be trapped in a \"trickle down\" system\n\nBut unlike traditional fiat money, bitcoin can't be created at will by a central bank.  Which means that if I have 1BTC, I know - with 100% certainty - that I own one 21 millionth of the economy.  If I have 1 US dollar right now on the other hand, whatever fraction of the economy it is, it will be a smaller fraction tomorrow as the federal reserve keeps on creating more.\n\n> large banks have likely already gobbled up whatever they could.\n\nThe bitcoin ledger is public.

    "body": "It\u2019s a complicated question because it\u2019s so unlike anything we\u2019ve seen before.\n\nI like to compare it to gold. Let\u2019s break down the properties of gold.\n\nFungibility - High\nPortability - Moderate\nDurability - High\nHighly Divisible - Moderate\nSecure (can\u2019t be counterfeit) - Moderate\nEasily Transactable -  Low\nScarce - Moderate\n\nGold has a $7-$8 trillion dollar market, and is considered one of the best ways to store value around the world.\n\nLet\u2019s look at Bitcoin.\n\nFungibility - High\nPortability - High\nDurability - High\nHighly Divisible - High\nSecure (can\u2019t be counterfeit) - High\nEasily Transactable -  High\nScarce - High\n\nYou can move any fraction of bitcoin around the world in seconds, without anyone\u2019s permission, without the use of a bank, and without having to physically move any object.\n\nIn addition, its:\n\n- Not issued by a government\n- Completely decentralized \n- Programmable \n\nIt cannot be seized by anyone, unlike gold. You can store bitcoin as a memory and take it with you anywhere, unlike gold. You can store the same value in multiple locations, unlike gold. You don\u2019t need to spend a lot of money to move it, unlike gold. The ledger of all transactions is public and accessible by anyone, unlike gold. There will only ever be 21M bitcoins, yet we can mine for more gold. Anyone in any country can buy/sell or send/receive bitcoin, unlike gold. \n\nWhen you look at it like this, it makes a very strong case for bitcoin being Gold 2.0. Why would you buy gold when you can store wealth digitally? \n\nCurrently bitcoin is a $0.17 trillion market, compared to golds $8 trillion. So with some simple math we could work out that if more wealth was stored with bitcoin, the price of each unit will increase in value because of the limited supply.\n\nFor example,  if 5% of the gold market moved to bitcoin, that would make bitcoin a $400 billion market. Currently there are only 17,000,000 bitcoins, so $400B divided by 17M put the price per bitcoin at $23,529. \n\nIs it reasonable to think bitcoin could one day be a trillion dollar market? Sure it is.\n\nWell 1 trillion divided by 17M would put the price per unit at $47,619.\n\nSo the question is, will people trust bitcoin and crypto currency to store their wealth better than alternatives? Well, they already are.\n\nAnd we haven\u2019t even touched on bitcoins utility yet and all the industries it can disrupt. This is just talking about one use (store of value)."

Once you sell your first amount and transfer it to your bank account you see how simple it really is. \n\nSometimes hearing it explained makes it sound way more daunting than it is. If you can bank online you can sell coin on an exchange. \n\nThe only thing is most exchanges have limits - where you can only transfer $500,000 per week or something like that. \n\nSo if youre selling $2 million worth of Bitcoin - it may take several seperate withdrawls spread out over a few weeks. But thats only when youre dealing in 6 and 7-figure amounts. At which point youre too happy that youre rich to care about being impatient :)"

So while you may only have one bitcoin, that can buy you more the further it goes up. For it to jump so rapidly, some major players must have entered the market. Theoretically it should just keep going up because its still becoming mainstream and people who werent in before are getting in now. What would drive it down would be for major players to sell off, but i would think anyone thats in it at the moment is probably in for the long ride. There may be a slight dip, but from what ive gathered the bitcoin following is expecting much bigger things in the future than just 10k"

It has intrinsic value as a precious metal that can be used in industrial applications and in small quantities in jewelry but no way in hell that value is thousands of dollars an ounce. That is pure speculation. When the end of days comes for fiat currency, the value of gold will drop to pennies.\n\nBitcoin has no intrinsic value. I can go into my garage and make 23 unique bent nails. Say you have  one or two stores in town that take bent nails. Now you have thousands of people suddenly speculating that those bent nails are worth huge sums of money. \n\nWithout the speculation you just have 23 bent nails that have very very close to a value of $0"

That means that one of the following scenarios will likely happen\n\n1. The 5% a day trend continues, and Bitcoin will hit $20,000 USD in the next two weeks \n2. The price increases speed up, to the moon! \n3. The trend flatlines, and Bitcoin stops rising. Speculators pull out, stop-losses get hit, and the price begins to fall. \n4. As above, but the prices falls really fast and it's a crash.\n\nI have no idea what the relative probabilities of these four options are (well, I have *some* idea, but I'm not an expert), but I caution everyone buying bitcoin to make sure you have stop-losses set so that you'll sell automatically if the price falls to a certain point, instead of waking up one day and missing the chance to get out with most of your money intact.

Also, i believe if you withdraw money from the money you put in your IRA Roth, you won't truly have the opportunity to put that money back in since the amount you put in is capped every year. \n\nThe only thing i can truly afford without withdrawing from my IRA right now is putting in maybe 100 a week, I just feel like it's not good enough."

Start out buying 0.30, wait a week or two, see where the price is and buy another 0.30, repeat.\n\nSome of us have been around for a while. We've seen the rollercoaster. BTC has been bullish for a while now. Most think it's going to keep going with no drawback. The ones of us that have seen drawbacks are prepared and have less anxiety than we did before.\n\nOne fact: It's still early so getting in now is still good but I fear that early window is closing. Slowly closing but still closing.\n\nAnother fact: No one knows what is going to happen with the price. BTC and the blockchain has a ton of value. \n\nWhile I believe in bitcoin and the future of bank-less electronic transactions, it's still a volatile asset. I'll continue to acquire coin as well as have \"on-me\" wallet with a small amount for when I need to use it. I would never drop the amount of USD for one entire coin because of that volitility.\n"

Plus they want to sell you goods and services.\nSo they can lower the price of their goods right to the sweet spot that makes your spending will greater than the hoarding will. We are not used to this concept because we live in a debt system that is killing our savings and forces us to spend all the time creating more debt or everything collapses . With sound deflationary money you will think twice if you really need the product because of the incentive of wealth gains if you are not spending. It\u2019s much better for us and for the planet because we are wasting lots of resources and we can\u2019t consume for infinity in a finite world."

In 1997, the UK Treasury estimated the cost of Black Wednesday at \u00a33.4 billion. In 2005, documents released under the Freedom of Information Act revealed that the actual cost may have been slightly less, \u00a33.3 billion. Until the United Kingdom's decision to leave the European Union in June 2016 it was the most significant event to happen during its time as a member of the European Union and was made even more embarrassing as the United Kingdom was holding the Presidency of the European Communities at the same time.\n\nThe trading losses in August and September were estimated at \u00a3800 million, but the main loss to taxpayers arose because devaluation could have made them a profit.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28"

I'm not saying I support treating Bitcoin as an investment, because I will never EVER treat it that way. But That's not to say it can't be. The same as a saying a car can't be a weapon because it's intended to be a tool for transport. But they're still used as weapons by terrorists. "

Soros recognized the unfavourable position at which the United Kingdom joined the ERM, believing the rate at which the UK was brought into the Exchange Rate Mechanism was too high, their inflation was also much too high (triple the German rate), and British interest rates were hurting their asset prices.[5] Soros made over \u00a31 billion[6] in profit by short selling sterling."

The price of goods will rise rapidly compared to that currency.   \nWhen quality metal coins were made, they started trading for value above their metal content - we never got to see how this played out because kings / states imediety took control of mints and rapidly debased the quality metal coin.   \nBitcoin is like these new trusted coins, but no one can debase it.

Much of it is held oversears by people that use American coinage as a trusted store of value. All governments print money and \"devalue\" their currencies, but some do it more responsibly than others. Individuals use the currency of the least risk.  \n\nBitcoin is special in that it's issuance can not be controlled by any individual - nor influenced by any government. It is the most trustworthy currency - in fact trustless. At first everyone is skeptical of this, but we are now 9 years into the life of bitcoin and people now understanding its safety and it's awesomeness.  \nHyperinflation occurs when faith is lost in a currency. We are observing Hyperdeflation where trust rapidly accrues in a currency.\n\n"

I\u2019d recommend Electrum on your desktop (https://electrum.org), they make it fairly easy to keep your bitcoin secure by giving you 12-16 words in a particular order (this is called a \u201cseed\u201d) which you just have to write down and keep safe, then no matter what happens to your computer, as long as you have those words safe you can recover your bitcoin on another computer.\n\nJust be very cautious when setting up a wallet. Make sure your computer has been scanned for viruses or spyware, and id even recommend disconnecting from the internet when you create your Electrum wallet to be extra cautious. You can also password protect your wallet so that someone would need both your seed and your password to access your bitcoin.\n\nI hope this helps mate!"

Price always searches for value, its called price discovery, we go where no man has gone before, looking for what the price of Bitcoin might be.\n\nSometimes the market finds out that it was wrong, then a big price increase or decrease can happen, this is called a correction.\n\nJust looking at the fundamentals, There are only 16,708,000 Bitcoins in existence. 4 million are estimated to be lost. There are 5 billion people with access to banking, these are people who can buy Bitcoins. Doing the math you quickly find out that Bitcoins are in fact very scarce and that this price increase may not only be sustainable but that we might be in for further price increase as long as adoption continues at this rate."

The return on Investment has been higher than any market we have ever seen, so naturally this attracts alot of attention. \n\nYou can think of this market similar to the dot-com markets of the late 90s. During that era, we witnessed the birth of the Internet and the bubble that came with it. Right now we're witnessing the birth of blockchain technology, and hence the bubble that comes with it.\n\nYou can research what the blockchain is but I'll try to quickly explain. In essence, it allows for the creation of decentralised services. Bitcoin is the worlds first decentralised currency. It has no owners, no central servers, anyone can chose to participate and join the network. Its peer to peer (no middlemen), permissionless (no gatekeepers), open source (anyone can view the code/ monetary policy). This system is the exact opposite of what we currently have with the central banking system, where the fed had exclusive power over the currency. "

You don't have to buy 1BTC, you can buy 0.000001 if you wanted. \n\nCoinbase or Gemini are some exchanges. You can turn usd into btc.

Doesn\u2019t the long decimal place nature of it mean it will be hard to \u2018sense\u2019 the value of something, the way you automatically can with dollar-unit currency?\n\nWhat I mean is, right now, you kind of know that a pizza is worth about 5 or 10 bucks, a nice car worth $30K or whatever. But, with Bitcoin, won\u2019t you always have to convert the price into something you can more easily intuit? \n\nExample: Pizza A is BTC.00091, and pizza B is .00182. Pizza B is twice as much as A, but you (well, I at least) would have to calculate every single transaction and, if not convert back to dollars to compare, then at least find some rough comparison calc that I am unlikely to be able to do in my brain, on the spot. \n\nIs the long decimal-place structure of bitcoin a hindrance to its uptake by the masses, even if stability is assured?"

About 80% is done in China, and how does China produce electricity?  Most is produced by fossil fuels which contribute to CO2 emissions, so there is the question of a sustainable Bitcoin economy that appears to have a voracious need for electricity; it's energy intensive.  In a perfect World this would be done sustainably with wind and solar, and in fact it's heading in that direction...but...bitcoin could place an undue burden on the grid, even a sustainable one.

    "body": "I'll answer your questions. \n\nNo single entity is setting Bitcoin's price, it is decided by the market. When you say no one is going to buy a Bitcoin for $10k, that is demonstrably and probably false. The fact that people are buying 1 Bitcoin for 10k on the open market is the reason the price hit 10k.\n\nWhen you say, \"there's not a single time where it would be better to have 1 Bitcoin over,$10,000 actual dollars\", that is provably and demonstrably false. For one, the price of Bitcoin is now pushing 11k, so there's that. If I asked you, would you rather have $10k cash, or another highly liquid asset worth some multiple of 10k, which would you pick?\n\nLook at the handful of failing economies around the world. In Venezuela they are experiencing so much inflation, their paycheck might have 20% less buying power on Tuesday than it did on Monday. People are storing their wealth in Bitcoin to insulate it from bad monetary policy, and because Bitcoin isn't correlated to the stock market, and gives them more portfolio diversification. \nIt's also important to realize, I'm not saying people should have 100% crypto and that it should completely replace all forms of money. Just that a small holding of Bitcoin as part of a larger diversified portfolio including stocks, bonds, real estate, etc, is more diversified than it otherwise would be. This alone justifies a value much higher than it currently sits at, given the relatively small supply of Bitcoin and the enormous growing demand."

Why?  because the art market reached a consensus on that value - by the fact that if you put it for sale, someone would pay that much for it.\n\nIf you offer 1 bitcoin for $10,000 right now, i guarantee people will flood your inbox.  that's a free $1,000 to them."

Some lucky few own enough for that to be worth a million dollars or more (would require owning 100btc currently). So no, we aren\u2019t all millionaires. But our worth is currently going up and our investment doing well. Will that continue? No one knows. In a year will bitcoin be worth $50k or $5? No one knows for sure. Those invested hope it keeps going well and adoption rises, more vendors get on board and accept it, and our investment pays off. Some say it\u2019s going to crater as a speculative bubble and everyone will wake up one day and see we actually own nothing. Time will tell. "

They have scammed everyone involved, including governments that *have actual laws in place prohibiting alternative currencies, like the United States*, to go along with this scam.\n\nThey are worth exactly $0, and their use creates an artificial monetary exchange outside of the standard channels of currency, which can create black markets and other shady exchanges of high value goods.  Bitcoin is an illegal scam done by a huge group of scam artists that make their fake, illegal pseudo-currency only worth what they think it's worth.  At least actual currencies have the backing of national and world banks with some sort of force of value and legitimacy behind it.\n\nI have pushed for the criminalization of bitcoin since its inception, only to have my logical, common sense pleas fall on deaf ears because of greed and the delusion of people to join in on a pyramid scheme.  This is not a \"boo hoo, I didn't get in on the ground floor so I'm salty\" rant, since I had ample opportunities to do just that, and did not because I knew right from wrong.\n\nBitcoin should be illegal and its value completely worthless."

People are sheep and they emulate the stupid they see on tv because der-hur, herp-derp, it's funny/cool to be dumb now days.  Intellect is not something that is celebrated in American culture.  Homer Simpson is seen as an \"everyman\" and that idea that stupid=funny=good is a key component to a lot of the anti-intellectualism that leads to the dumbing down of America.\n\nStupid people are easier to rule.\n"

If this doesn't happen you lose. Similarly you could still lose even if you decided today's price is $x and you want to sell them all. It doesn't follow that you will get $x does it? Selling isn't an instantaneous press of a button as it is in a trading app.\n\nUltimately, of course, if you bought at 12 cents and held you would have more money than continually selling and buying at a higher price. i.e the buy/sell thing has been losing you money, even if you are still in profit.

    "body": "**HODL**\n\nHODL is a slang term and Internet meme that is used in the Bitcoin community when referring to keeping, i.e. holding onto the cryptocurrency rather than selling it. It originated in a December 2013 post on the Bitcoin Forum message board by an apparently inebriated user who posted with a typo in the subject, \"I AM HODLING.\" In 2017, Quartz listed it as one of the essential slang terms in Bitcoin culture, and described it as a stance, \"to stay invested in bitcoin and not to capitulate in the face of plunging prices.\" The Street.com referred to it as the \"favorite mantra\" of Bitcoin holders. According to the Financial Times, it was the reddit forum Buttcoin that helped popularize its use.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28"

Yeah you good traders can spot the highs and the lows pit pat piffy wing wong wang just like that and make a millino bucks sure no problem bro.  Likewise the weak hands are like OH NO IT'S GOING DOWN I'M GONNA SELL he he he and then they're like OH GOD MY ASSHOLE when the SMART traders who KNOW WHAT THE FUCK THEY'RE DOING buy back in but you know what?  I'm not part of that group.  When the traders buy back in I'm already part of the market capital so GUESS WHO YOU'RE CHEATING day traders NOT ME~!  Those taunt threads saying \"OHH YOU SHOULD HAVE SOLD\" YEAH NO SHIT.  NO SHIT I SHOULD HAVE SOLD.  I SHOULD HAVE SOLD MOMENTS BEFORE EVERY SELL AND BOUGHT MOMENTS BEFORE EVERY BUY BUT YOU KNOW WHAT NOT EVERYBODY IS AS COOL AS YOU.  You only sell in a bear market if you are a good day trader or an illusioned noob.  The people inbetween hold.  In a zero-sum game such as this, traders can only take your money if you sell.\n\nso i've had some whiskey\n\nactually on the bottle it's spelled whisky\n\nw/e\n\n-sue me\n\n(But only if it's payable in BTC) "

Bitcoin means nothing and has no value if no one is buying anything in cryptocurrency. So few vendors actually take it. And why would you spend it if you think its value is increasing? And why would a vendor take it if its value can decrease overnight? Volatility is not a desirable trait in currency. Crypto as it is now discourages people from spending it and using it for its intended purpose.

What would create stability in the market? \n\nI'll assume (just for fun) deflation becomes stable at 2%. What happens then is people take advantage of the risk-less arbitrage opportunity of a 4-5% net return by buying and holding Bitcoin. There's fundamentally no winning a currency battle when holding offers you more benefits than trading. \n\nI'm not sure what philosophical angle you expect me to buy into, but saying it has anything to do with \"humans main purpose\" isn't an economic argument.

    "body": "That's the thing, \"value\" is relative. Bitcoin from a simple standpoint is an asset that is experiencing hyperdeflation, that's the main reason big players are scooping this thing up, it has potential reaching price levels exponentially higher (long-term).\n\nThat's another topic. You could argue that Bitcoin value represents blockchain itself, BTC being the daddy himself of all crypto is being seen as a brand, as an \"index\" of the whole sphere, and let's be honest, blockchain is just getting started. I disagree that 100% value comes from speculation, how much full control of your asset means to you? An asset no one could ever reverse or take from you (given appropriate security measures). Speculation is big part of what Bitcoin is today, but definitely not everything."

There is a crazy bull run which goes hyperbolic before pulling back. In theory it will continue this pattern if they become mainstream and are used everyday. Just be patient. It isn't easy, but if you invest in a cryptocurrency which will be widely used 10 years from now then you will be very well off."

Merchants used scales for every transaction and some would rig them to steal value. It was hard to divide gold and to move it. Bitcoin can be easily sent anywhere in the world, it's extremely easy to move it, it's easily divisible, and it's insanely secure. If your issue is with the speed and fees, the lightning network makes moving Bitcoin instant and practically free."

The Fed chair doesn't sit at the money-printer-go-brrrr button all day and respond to fluctuations in the exchange price of the dollar with infusions of liquidity into banks or selling treasuries.\n\nThe u.s. dollar is stable, because it has a very large market cap and because once an asset is money (i.e. serves to a high degree as unit of account, medium of exchange, and store of value) it has a lot of expectational inertia...people rely on it to price everything else and it becomes difficult to shift all those expectations."

So by that, if you were going to withdrawal the bitcoin for fiat to purchase something, you might as well send the bitcoin directly and not have to pay a fee, if that company allows it.\n\nIt's another step in bitcoin becoming a \"real\" everyday currency which is what will ultimately drive up its price.

Yes , yes if you put a gun to my head I\u2019d agree ... sure it\u2019s a commodity , but I don\u2019t see what relevance that has to anything at all. People will spend bitcoin when they feel it is in their interest to do so and I don\u2019t believe I can predict the future , and determine when,  if , how or why that is or may be the case . BUT volatility IS decreasing as a function of time which COULD have an impact on hording behaviour long term in my opinion. Though it will still by in large be held for long term storage regardless ... probably."

There's really no historical precedence for the adverse effect of deflationary currency on an economy. Exept for maybe gold, and economies boomed while using gold. \n\nI also said that the general thesis is that people won't spend their Bitcoins because it's deflationary. In response, I'm saying that everyone knows that fiat is inflationary. Yet, people still save in fiat. If Bitcoin is the currency of the future, people will still spend their Bitcoins even if they know it deflates. \n\nAlthough, I think this is subject to Gresham's law though. If there are other more worthless currencies in circulation, people would prefer to spend them than to spend real money like Bitcoin."

A pizza bought ten years ago with 10000 bitcoins is now the pizza that was bought for 50 million dollars worth of Bitcoin. Whereas a pizza bought ten years ago for ten dollars is now the pizza that was bought for the equivalent of 9 dollars (the dollar devalued since then because of, you guessed it, inflation).\n\nThis is just me talking about dollars. Then there\u2019s other currencies as well and all of them all experience inflation and devaluation."

It's something that let us have a \"private\" balance. We can exchange as many times as we want, for free. It's NOT on the Bitcoin blockchain, so it has no cost. We never share bitcoin or keys.\n\nIf later on we want to close the channel, we can publish the result of out balance, which gets stored on the chain. There are security mechanisms so we can't play dirty.\n\nFurthermore if you want to pay me, we probably don't need to open a channel. You have a channel with someone else, and I also do. It's a network, so we can automatically use those channels. That costs a bit. Like, 1-2sats per transaction.\n\nSo it's really cool. There are some nice wallets that deal with all this. So if you download Phoenix Wallet (Android) or Breez (iOS), and send me an invoice, I'll give you some sats."

    "body": "Your response demonstrates a misunderstanding in how both the fed and Bitcoin consensus function.\n\n1. The Federal Reserve is independent of the government, so technically the government shouldn't get to decide when QE (printing) takes place. Regardless, if you truly think the government is acting in the best interests of the average citizen, I'm afraid even bitcoin can't save you.\n\n2. In the event of a hard fork to increase bitcoin issuance, each node decides for ITSELF whether it wants to accept the new rules. This leads to a fork, like seen with BCH. Then the market can ascribe valuation to both chains. It's very similar to a stock split except each of the two \"shares\" you get have different fundamentals."

Something with no worth in and of itself.\n\nSome things like gold actually do have intrinsic value thanks to their usefulness in various industrial and technological applications. The value is artificially inflated somewhat by humans liking to hoard shiney things but still. Take away industry and things like water, salt, and food will still always have value."

I think some people see it as a good thing that you can be your own banker, and store millions without it being used and borrowed out by the giant financial institutions.  That\u2019s why FDIC exists. To ensure you that (I believe up to 250k) a large sum of your money is always available in the bank"

    "body": "I know very little about bitcoin and how to use it and all of this, but I can answer one  reason bitcoin is better than fiat currencies. \n\nThe amount of new bitcoins that will be made is set. if you have a bunch of US dollars and hold it for 20 years, it will be worth far less in twenty years period, because the US will print up far more dollars, and your dollars will be worth less and less.\n\nWith bitcoin, it certainly could be worth less in 20 years, it could disappear, if people decide its not a good choice of currency. In this regard it's risky and volatile, for sure. BUT, it doesnt suffer from inflation.\n\nThis isnt a full answer to your question, just commenting what I do know enough to say with confidence. ( I could link to like stats on how many dollars are printed and how fast the US dollar is inflating, but im too lazy)."

But people know him and identify him as a figurehead for futurism \u2014\u00a0which is fantastic for Bitcoin because it bolsters that association, particularly among people who still need to be swayed.\n\nYou could use a similar argument to fairly state that there are better cryptos than BTC out there: X coin is faster than BTC; Y coin is more secure, yadda yadda. Doesn't matter. Bitcoin is the most widely recognised and heralded crypto out there, and symbolises a shift. It's all brand, baby."

He's thinking about accepting it as. You know who else is thinking about accepting it as payment. Basically every major company under the sun. I can guarantee that every CFO had the talk, it's impossible to ignore, especially during a boom, but considering it and actually doing it and then actually doing it in a way that isn't super consumer unfriendly (eg stopping a purchase if it dips, but happily letting it go through if it spikes) are all very, very different things."

If you could avoid taxes by simply not using a fiat currency, people would have used something else for years. \n\nWhen the feds were in the dark and the things purchased were ether illegal or small or both, you could use crypto to dodge certain taxes. Buying a car, something you have to register with the government isn't really something you can safely avoid paying taxes on."

Why would Tesla decide any differently? You can't use something as volatile as BTC as a medium of exchange. Tesla doing this shit is just feeding that volatility and further demonstrating why BTC will probably never be a legitimate currency.\n\nThis sub is so deluded."

The node decentralization, which is the mechanism that enforces consensus, is what defines the decentralization of bitcoin.  Each node maintains a copy of the blockchain.  Using cryptography, you query your replicated node for the blockchain, and sign transactions that are ultimately recorded in the blockchain that is distributed to all nodes.  It is this ability to apply cryptography to your copy of the blockchain on your node that makes it private.  It's the fact that your changes are recorded on the blockchain that is recorded on every node, that makes it decentralized.\n\nI'm not sure you understand anything about this technology at all."

If you price in Satoshi, you end up with prices similar to the Yen (currently 104 Yen to a dollar).\n\nOnce volatility has settled and adoption is wide, we can consider what our day-to-day units will be. What's particularly nice about Bitcoin is you can fairly easily have localized units if you really want to. Locally, prices might be in, IDK, 1/10,000,000th of a Bitcoin. If there is a simple standard HTML tag for a price, and all prices online are set in whole BTC, browsers can easily convert to your local unit. It actually has the potential to make pricing (particularly internationally) much simpler."

    "body": "But bitcoin is not money or a currency, not anymore. It's a storage of value. And just like gold or other similar assets, the price of it can swing like crazy, but on the long run it will only go up. If you want crypto that actually works as a currency, there are faster, lower fee per transaction and better tech crypto with way higher supply limit which have potential to be actual everyday currency without the minuses of bitcoin (the fear to use it because it's value keeps going up is an important one). But for that to happen these new currencies need to prove themselves and be adopted as such, which will take awhile for an actual contender to appear"

That means you need to FIND USD (which you have, through Visa or Mastercard or whatever).  However, that means that you're paying conversion fees to Visa/Mastercard, and the IRS makes you pay for the credit card fees *too*, so you're generating SOME level of commerce in their country.\n\nMost people wouldn't bother with this effort if they could keep USD alone and USD was relatively stable.\n\n>  Does that make US dollars somehow more more than just a transactional currency that has no use except through which to transfer one value from one system to another?\n\nYOU are using it for that.  And people COULD use it for that.  But if people are required to obtain USD for *something* and are offered to be paid in it, most will take it.  And when the government pays, it'll only pay in their own currency (which is another way to create demand for the currency that I didn't address).  \n\n> The system you envisage, which is only necessary for the purpose of paying government employees, is how you wind up with zimbabwe hyperinflation.\n\nNo it isn't; you end up with hyperinflation when you print too much money.\n\n> You people really haven't thought this through. I'm not even sure if you can convince yourself.\n\nWho is \"you people\"?  What group am I a part of that says \"Taxes incentivize the usage of the currency it is demanded in\"?

More widespread adoption by larger companies (along the lines of Tesla) only further increases the likelihood of it being in the conversation for a lot longer.\n\nI think the fact of the matter is that most fiat currencies are losing value yearly, and it's whether or not you're happy with that or believe in bitcoin being a more stable way to store your money.\n\nDisclaimer: not financial advise, just a dumb monkey trying to figure this shit out too."

No. \n\nWell, it's hard to predict, but to say that it is not a problem is not right. About 70% of all of the BTC is bought with Tether and then fuelled in to unregulated exchanges which do not have to report back their financials. As far as I've read, there is like 30% less USDT than there is USD that bought USDT hoping that it was $1 USD vs $1 USDT. Essentially this creates a huge liquidity problem not only for tether, but for all the big exchanges (like Binance). It's almost like a pyramid scheme, as long as more USD come in through Tether, everything is fine.\n\n>You think most of Bitcoins price is driven by Tether?\n\nNo, I don't think that Tether is the only thing that moves the needle. Obviously an A list company investing huge portion of it's cash in one or another publicly traded asset would drive the price of that assets regardless of what the asset was."

Even if they spread them evenly amongst all milllionaires, that would only lead to 0.3 per millionaire. But millionaires, like every part of society, aren't the same. There are people with one, two, five, 20, 50, 100 and then there are the billionaires. For some people 0.1 bitcoin is already unachievable. Soon that will be 0.01. Soon millionaires will be trying to achieve 0.1. Then 0.01.\n\nWe are so so so early."

Only it has an advantage over gold because it\u2019s weightless and you don\u2019t need a vault to store a million dollars worth of it, and it has an advantage over land because you can transport it easily and you don\u2019t have to pay property taxes. Don\u2019t think of it necessarily as a payment method, but as a savings method that you can also transfer relatively easily to someone else. It\u2019s not \u201cget rich quick\u201d for people with only a little bit of extra money to throw into it. Sure you can make a couple thousand in a year, but the real game changer is it will allow the average person to save up and buy their house in cash in 10 years instead of getting a mortgage and paying it off over 30."

At the time it was worth a few hundred pounds (the bits I owned). Then several months later, that same value was more than doubled (now those same bits would be worth more than a thousand). How is Bitcoin a viable option for purchasing things when its value fluctuates so wildly? One day you're buying a Tesla car with a Bitcoin worth 32K and tomorrow Bitcoin takes a nose dive and Tesla is left with your Bitcoin now only worth 7k , instead of the original 32k .. It doesn't make sense to me, can someone enlighten me please :)\n\nEveryone i know who owns Bitcoin is owning it for the real world dollars they can make from trading it. Nobody I know buys anything with it. So what is the long term value of Crypto Currency? To make people rich? The whole thing feels like a get rich quick for people with capital to invest."

With the price always going up, people are hesitant to let go of it in payment for something they want, on the chance that BTC will go up and they can get it cheaper next week. But that very hesitance causes the price to continue to go up, making people even MORE hesitant to spend it, making the problem worse. \n\nIt's called a \"deflationary spiral\" and it's really, really hard to stop once it's started.\n\nOf course, when you have a rapid FALL in the price of BTC, you have the reverse problem: nobody wants to accept it in payment on the chance that it will be worth less before they can convert it into something else they want. That's inflation.\n\nRight now BTC is swinging wildly between rapid deflation and rapid inflation...it's fine as a speculative investment but as a means of payment it's pretty much worthless, because one side of the transaction is always hesitant to accept it."

I mean, it will stay but man it will not come close to Bitcoin not even in a million year( not even close tho Ethereum) then I sold all of my Dogecoin and put my money into Eth and Bitcoin. Just after a week, I can say, man the longer I would have waited the more I had to pay for Eth and Bitcoin (It is not even close to single unit).But slowly I will pave my way to get some Eth and Bitcoin it will take time for sure but it will worth it :)"

For the individual- in your daily life you\u2019ll be spending with a stable coin such as DAI, which is backed through holdings of ETH earning staking interest, and/or leveraged against the underlying holding of wrapped BTC as a smart contract.

I however do not think it's necessary to use bitcoin as a medium of exchange. I think bitcoin will remain a settlement layer for large transactions between corporations and governments and the fiat systems will operate as a layer on top.\n\nUnless another layer comes along and disrupts that which would be difficult because the usd layer has value still and into the future because usd and other fiat can be reversed.

Given the fact that it is incredibly costly in terms of power, and incredibly bad at lightning transactions, what is the purpose of it in regards to TSLA?\n\nBecause its the most famous criptocuyrrency, bitcoins has tons of users because it was the first and and was famous, and people go for bitcoin instead of other crypto because that reason only.\n\nBitcoin is basically the d&d of cryptocurrency, or the mainstream music or electric guitar of cryptocurrency."

Nevermind what or how they use people.\" \n\nWhich is my issue with Elon Musk. He should have faced penalties for saying \"Fuck the government. They can't tell me what to do amist a global pandemic along the backdrop of a rising affront to the very government's existence and the safety of a nation.\""

That's why you have to take care to have backups and keep your passwords safe. Meanwhile, you can take all the precautions in the world with your checking/savings/brokerage accounts and some bank can make a mistake and leave *you* holding the bag. So what you're complaining about with Bitcoin is actually a *good* thing."

Dirty energy is what is hurting our environment.\n   \nBitcoin helps to bring awareness about dirty energy consumption and awareness is what we need if we are going to motivate the masses to do something about it.\n  \nTesla does a lot to make power more efficient and that includes dirty energy.  Take coal power generation for instance.  Right now they have to burn coal at a set rate to maintain their inefficient systems.  This means they are burning more coal than they need to in order to feed the network and maintain what levels they need in the network so that energy is available when demand wants it.  The majority of this demand happens on a 24 hour schedule.  So as a result they end up generating an excess of power and they end up wasting energy.  Tesla products improve energy efficiency and allow these same coal plants to only burn as much coal as they need to serve their customers by improving the efficiency of the energy storage."

The big upside with a government backed currency is that the value of the currency can be controlled by changing the money supply (and velocity). Bitcoin can never be a stable currency for trade unless the supply can be controlled such that the value is constant. If the supply is fixed the value is only controlled by demand which is too volatile for business transactions, so it is really more of an investment vehicle than a currency."

    "body": "Debt. All national currencies are backed by debt. A government can control the money supply by printing money and lending it out to banks. The banks then lend it out to businesses and individuals. Money has value since all the loans eventually needs to be paid back with money. Think of money as the opposite of an IOU. From nothing you can create a dollar and an opposite IOU. The government keeps all the IOUs and the money circulates. If there is to little money in circulation the economy slows down and we get deflation so the government prints more money and IOUs. To much money means an overheated economy and inflation so the government reduces money supply by demanding their money back. A very simplified explanation..."

Your attitude highlights the fact that very few people will be able to afford a whole coin moving forward and that the amount of people that can will be reduced as time goes on.  But thankfully you can buy fractions of a coin and if you do it over time it can really add up as Bitcoin realizes its future potential."

You do realize that it is created by someone who can easily cause the currency to lose value if they feel as such. Heck, it can be lost by a major power surge on the primary servers that hold the software which creates crypto currencies.. Don\u2019t even start about cost behind crypto currencies as real world currencies such as the USD are based on real commodities that can be utilized in the event of an economic collapse. You think the US government can\u2019t just enact a war engagement act if crypto currencies force the USD out of power? They killed Ghadaffi over trying to introduce the Gold Dinar, a currency that was actually made of gold. I guess you think power won\u2019t be cut and some bank will give you money for a software that can\u2019t even be traded for treasury notes.

Basically, they\u2019d take a small hit on profit per sale at the time of the transaction for the shot at the upside potential of hodling long term. Especially for smaller stuff like streaming services from Apple, Netflix, or Disney+.\n\nIt may help with overall adoption as a currency in the near term, though I do still believe that btc is currently a much better store of value than a currency in most situations.

People are still too spooked by the Bitcoin pizza to part with large amounts and many folks investing in it these days are doing so because they believe it will grow, not to actually make purchases (except on a pretty small scale for tiny fractions of a coin).  So, if you\u2019re a bitcoin investor, which almost everyone is, you\u2019re generally in it for the long game.\n\nI mean there\u2019s always the possibility that someone buys a Tesla on a spike before a dip happens and gets a great deal, but that\u2019s going to be a risky call.\n\nThe alternative is that Bitcoin *really* stabilises in which case it\u2019s useful as a currency, but then why not just use dollars?  And if that happens, it\u2019s no longer an interesting investment, so speculators will move on to something else.\n\nI don\u2019t really need most of the other benefits of crypto (i.e. anonymity) because I\u2019m going to have to register the damn car anyway, so I\u2019m not sure what advantages I\u2019m getting."

    "body": " \n\nThink people should be selling their $TSLA stock after this announcement.\n\nTesla was grossly overvalued already, and their decision to convert cash into bitcoin has made it worse, I guess. Now $1.5B worth of their assets is exposed to excessive market risks.\n\nEither they understand cryptocurrency, esp. bitcoin much better than the rest of us, or it could turn out to be a bad gamble. Anyhow, I don't understand the influencer fad and markets responding with massive moves - case of mistaking expertise in one area (engineering) for another (cryptocurrency).\n\nA simple valuation of bitcoin:  \n\\- Minimum amount that can be transferred is 546 Satoshis, i.e. 00000546 bitcoin  \n\\- Minimum dollar value \\[for transfer\\] is $0.01  \n\\- Therefore, bitcoin should be priced \\~$1,830\n\nIf we say that $1 is the minimum value we'd transfer using bitcoin, then sure the fair value is $183K. It could be anything between $1.83K and $183K - I'd think likely towards the lower end.\n\nPS: some would argue about the limited number of coins and draw a comparison with gold - the use case is different then (i.e. store of value and not remittance). Feel free to find out the total value of gold in the world, assume bitcoin takes 10% (or any other proportion) of the market, and find the fair value.\n\nPPS: I'm waiting for the overinflated markets to correct before I buy :)"

We should not let newcomers in the space feel overwhelmed. The basics of buying, selling, and transmitting crypto are actually super simple.\n\nCrypto still feels clunky and alien to us right now, just like email did to people in 1992. At the moment my Full Trust is in DEX. DEX is so perfect when match by personal responsibility to secure your assets. And I say that there are tons of good DEX's out there, with most of them relying on Ethereum, which doesn't scale well and has a lot of limitations, as you can't trade actual coins there. Different things with Blocknet. BLOCK is integrating into a multi-currency wallet, which was released yesterday., Their wallet is easy and convenient to trade."

It's free and does not take power on the mobile and you do not technically mining on the mobile, but are assigned crypto values. Just need wifi and push on a button once a day. You must be invited to use the app. Here is the invitation code: \n\nUse Pi code: NormannGumbs \n\nUse Bee code: normanng \n\nPi has 13 million members and may have a value at the end of the year \n\nBee has 7million and is growing fast. Was 3millon in January\n\nHope this is helpful for cryptocurrency enthusiasts:-)"

Well kidding aside I guess more and more companies like Tesla are slowly turning to crypto to expand their opportunities just like [BTCS](https://www.btcs.com/). \n\nThey are considered as one of the first U.S. publicly traded companies focused on digital assets and blockchain technologies. As a matter of fact in 2017, they created a first of its kind digital asset treasury strategy which is now being widely employed by companies such as Tesla, Square, and MicroStrategy.\n\nSo you see, crypto is def the future."

While I agree that most are, it\u2019s becoming an increasing battle to make a case for making your own token as opposed to using the underlying blockchain coin. It\u2019s even becoming to the point where you discuss ICO or crowdsale and you are immediate looked down upon. So unless, we expect projects with zero resources,  I\u2019d be hard pressed to see any motivation for getting crypto other than to speculate. So what do we actually mean when we say purpose here?"

I bet only about 1% of all crypto holders worldwide actually have a deep understanding of the tech behind the crypto they hold. The other 99% only understand two things: how/where to buy, and price trend. They don't know and frankly don't care how the tech works, because while the entire crypto market is still in its mania phase, there's almost no difference between the smart money and stupid money in the market."

Youtube, Discord, Reddit all full of wannabe traders and the money grab and shilling of \"ICOs\" just demonstrate how the capatilist society works. In the early days of Crypto the vision was so much more noble, and I was enjoying the slow growth of the asset until all the trading fiasco really kicked in. I think its too late now and it's become a real money grab. But I commend these comments from Vitalik."

Also correct me if I\u2019m wrong but I think so far he hasn\u2019t spent a single ether from his own stash nor has he converted anything to another currency, which means if he stops working and ETH crashes, he won\u2019t be rich anymore.\n\nWhat he\u2019s saying is true though. If the crypto community keeps focusing on artificially inflated prices for products still in development, this whole market is going to crash hard. The current price of nearly all coins and tokens out there is solely based on potential, not in money they\u2019re actually generating. Once we get from alphas and betas go working products being used everyday, then we can start talking about real (and probably bigger) prices. But all that takes time and effort on the devs side and also a community of users and holders trying to get the project as widely known as possible. "

Meanwhile, none f you can have a conversation concerning Vitalik because all you can say is \u201co he has has money I don\u2019t\u201d.  Also I noticed you changed your numbers right after you posted your comment, did you read them wrong? :) I\u2019m a happy holder of all three, but you represent the worst of the communities."

No. A job is just the service an employee is getting paid for-- no company/mgr/owner wants to pay for shitty service, though some may be incompetent (and employees too)\n\n(3) \"The ones who make this cheap shit are underpaid\" - Asians are doing better than ever and their standard of living and salaries have skyrocketed under more capitalism.\n\n(4) \"Capitalism is a system where the goal is money itself.\"- No, a capitalist market is about voluntary trade of goods and property rights. People buy stuff with money. That's why trade is at alltime highs. That's why people are buying things all the time, improving their standard of living.\n\nI recommend some fresh air and read some pro-capitalist & classical liberal or libertarian stuff because it seems you were brainwashed with some bad advice form some old leftists."

Ever looked around how many ultra-cheap look-alike products are available on the market? \n\nCheapness sells like hell, even if the resulting product doesn't even work or breaks after a few uses. Nothing sells better than a low price tag, the product that comes with the price tag is often enough ignored.\n\nThe ones who make this cheap shit are underpaid (mostly in Asian countries), resources are spilled, the products become waste shortly after purchase. But it helps the current \"growth-based economy\". to compensate for the shitty product, a lot is invested in \"PR\" (advertisment, creating hypes, ...), and only very few peoples (which I call \"capitalists\") gain something decent out of this. To make it worse: this stuff depends on mass production which means big players are at a certain point almost impossible to compete with. (almost, at some point there is always someone who can make a difference in some way, starting small, but smart)\n\nIt's like an empty Christmas present: but a big one wrapped in a beautiful, shiny paper...\n\nThe goal isn't the money, but what the money can be traded for.\nCapitalism is a system (or way of (not) thinking) where the goal is money itself."

    "body": "> capitalistic approach tries to ignore the source of our well being: labour, resources of raw materials, services\n\nYou obviously don't know much about business or a \"capitalistic\" approach.  \n\nPeople in business care FAR MORE about those than most people, because for one, they are needed to make money obviously. \n\nEver hear of business that wants shitty employees? Business wants good or the best employees. That means paying and treating good employees well. Tech companies for example,  invest a ton of money into employees... which means it's in the company's interest to retain them (or lose the money invested, leading to lower profits).\n\nOn the other hand, treating employees like shit (and having that reputation) leads to people leaving, company operations disrupted, company goals missed, potentially losing to competitors, lower stock value and thus... owners and managers making much LESS money than they could have.\n\nAlso, raw materials and labor are =major cost centers so a good business person has to maximize utility with them. If they don't then (1) they are losing money and potential profit, and (2) will lose to competitors who do maximize them, and (3) go out of business.... therefore, not making any money.\n\nGo to the most successful businesses and they get high marks from employees, who also get high salaries/benefits.\n\nAs far as eating money-- Edibility doesn't matter. There are many productive things that I cannot eat. My computer is productive and I can't eat it. A house is useful and I can't eat it. Societies that productively allocate private capital/labor for profit (capitalist) never have had to eat money. \n\nThere are flaws in the monetary system and they are directly caused by the government monopoly on money and collusion with banks, not businesses in general."

    "body": "I'm very happy that there are still people around like mr. Buterin, that realize that 'money' (be it fiat, crypto or bare gold) is nothing more than a practical exchange item. It has no value on it's own. \n\nUnfortunately the so called capitalistic approach tries to ignore the source of our well being: labour, resources of raw materials, services, ... and a lot of people talk like having money is being rich. Try eating money when you're hungry and you will see what I mean. There's an age old story about a king who wished everything he touches turned into gold. He died shortly after his wish was fulfilled...\n\nI hope in deciding the future development of Ethereum, decisions will plain ignore the ideas of those who are in Ethereum pure as a money gaining investment. Decisions should be made to make the Ethereum blockchain as useable and practical as possible. \n\nIf you look at Bitcoin on this moment: the value has risen not because it became so practical, but because it is failing. It is impossible that all the money pumped into BTC will ever get exchanged back to fiat. And I would not even think about accepting BTC as a means of payment for any goods or services I sell either.\nKnowing that Bitcoin is no more than a means of exchange (for goods or other currency), everyone who is only a little sane can smell what will happen, unless Bitcoin can solve the problem of slowness & high fees in a very short term. If only a few people would have invested in bitcoins this wouldn't be a problem, but senseless 'popularity' drawed so much attention of people who actually have no clue, and only a few will make 'profit' at the end. Profit that in fact serves no one except those few...\nRemember the economic value of something is nothing more than the price the biggest fool wants to pay for it... the real value is something you can't push.\n\nThe real value is only there if you can exchange the currency (fiat/crypto/anything else) for something you actually need. As long as it's a number in a graph, you can cheer as much as you want, you only cheer about air (well, actually about 'ether'/void, as air is something you actually need).\n\nI hope the value of ETH will not rise the same way as bitcoin and instead it will become (or stay, imho;) the best worked out blockchain tech around (mainly due to it's founders actually having a view on how the world turns around). I see blockchain technology as an immature thing right now. Promises a lot, but we are not there yet. I hope mr. Buterin will keep up with the good work and will be able not to get demotivated by those who see Ethereum just as a method of gambling."

Bitcoin itself looks a bit like myspace or askjeeves to me right now; a popular proof of concept which will eventually be dwarfed by a more lasting and refined global giant. While it is extremely popular right now, most people are not using bitcoin, there is absolutely massive potential for growth. \n\nI can't yet tell where eth will fall in this analogy.

So while the rich do get richer, the poor get much, much, much richer over time. The Uber rich will always be fine, no matter what scheme society is running. But the only places where the average Joe has really been able to improve his lot have been societies that do not discourage productive use of capital. Hence the great migration to the freest country in the world during the 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries. People still migrate to the US from certain countries, generally ones with lower degrees of personal freedom."

    "body": "Thanks. I see where you're coming from I think, but I don't think the real world is really like that. I mean to an extent it certainly is. There really are job creators who make great stuff and we all benefit. But to assume that that accounts for an entire economic system doesn't take the whole picture into account.\n\n> This way, the people who make the most people's lives better will have the most money, and the people who do the least for anyone else will have the least money.\n\nThis is the part where you lose me. We can argue about how big a factor inheritance is, but let's assume for the sake of argument that everyone is on perfectly equal footing to begin with. The people who get the most money aren't necessarily the ones who are best at producing things that people value. They're just the best at acquiring money.  To find an example of something that makes lots of money but doesn't actually produce something positive for society, just look at the myriad ways poor people are preyed upon: pay day loans, rent-to-own furniture and electronics, the lottery, pyramid schemes... Sure, people value this stuff, but the fact that somebody wants to spend a lot of money on something doesn't necessarily mean it's a good thing to spend money on or that it contributes positively to society. You can say that people who blow all their money on renting a stereo system at a high interest rate deserve to be poor because they did it to themselves, and you might be right, but the point stands that the guy who owns Rent-A-Center isn't rich because he's the best at producing value to society. He's rich because he's good at acquiring money.\n\nAnd to the point about government interference, what about the recent vote by the senate to prevent class action suits being filed against banks? Without class action suits, people are forced into arbitration, which is great if you're a bank trying to keep as much of your money to yourself as possible. Wealthy people like to maintain and expand their fortunes; you're absolutely right about that. Papa John wants his pizzas to taste good so that people will continue to buy them from him. But rules like \"no class action lawsuits\" don't benefit the whole society. They only benefit the people already at the top."

    "body": "I never said you were stupid. It has, however, been my experience that the overwhelming majority of Redditors prefer not to think. And ok here's the short version. You cannot be rich if all you've got is money. Venezuelans have buckets of it but it doesn't do anything for them because it cannot buy them very much. What you really need to improve your life is not money, it's stuff. Money can be traded for stuff, but only if that stuff exists in the first place. The best way to get stuff to exist is just allow people to make as much of it as possible, and allow people to transfer value to them if they provide some stuff that people want. This way, the people who make the most people's lives better will have the most money, and the people who do the least for anyone else will have the least money. Obviously with things like inheritance and gifts, this isn't exactly true, but it's a pretty close approximation. I hope this makes sense so far. That's about half of it. The second half is why it's better this way than taking from the productive for the benefit of the unproductive. \n\nThe reason it's better this way is that the people who already have the most money in society will usually seek to increase their wealth (and indirectly increase wealth inequality) by leveraging their existing wealth in the production of yet more highly demanded goods. These wealthy people generally tend to want to maintain and expand their fortunes so they have a massive incentive to maintain the quality and quantity demanded by consumers of whatever they produce. If they are producing something people don't want, they will quickly discover that whatever resources utilized in that line of production can make them more profit in another line of production that is actually demanded by consumers. As long as there is no government interference with this system, it's impossible for anybody to get rich without benefitting lots of people on the way, even if it was never his intention to help anyone besides himself. The amount of money they'll have compared to lowly wage workers will be astounding. But it will not be out of proportion with the magnitude of the positive impact they've had on the lives of consumers through providing cheap and high quality goods. This ensures that anyone helping themselves must first help others, instead of the other way around. Redistributing wealth takes from some to give to others, instead of both parties benefitting. This sows the seeds of division and stratifies society much more concretely than voluntary interaction alone ever could. If you want to help poor people the most, you should seek not to punish the rich, but to make it as straightforward as possible for the poor to be as productive as they possibly can, so that their real wages are higher and they can have more stuff, not just more pieces of paper.\n\nObviously there's more to it and I'd recommend reading a few books on Austrian economics if you're really interested."

It sounds like Vitalek needs to stop talking about the price and focus on developing ether. Or we could just use a better coin. Like ubiq. Probably just solidifies an incoming bear market for crypto in general. The hype has been there for a year. Now it's time for devs and teams to take profits and start developing for the next couple years until the next wave of mainstream adoption. "

There are a few stores in Japan that accept Bitcoin but if that is their use case, then it's basically competing with the Suica card system that's already in place and already accepted for purchasing as well.\n\nAlso, why should anyone invest in one particular crypto over another? With hard currencies, you're betting on the stability and growth of a particular country's economy. With crypto, it is.... What?\n\nFinally, what does it mean to actually buy crypto? To invest? But again, there isn't much hard real world value you're investing in: it's like investing in a startup that does nothing but have other investors invest in it.\n\nEven though crypto has phenominal returns, I would never invest because I personally do not understand the value behind it."

    "body": "My experience is that salons that offer fixed rate regardless of stylist tend to be either super high end (where every cut costs over 100$), super low end (supercuts where every stylist will give you a shit cut for 20$) or franchises (where good stylists generally only stick around until they have a client base to go to a better salon) Either you get a super mediocre, bordering on crappy, cut for 30-40$ or you get lucky and get a good stylist who hasn't left yet and get a good cut for the same amount.  \n\n\nIndependent small salons tend to have stylists who are independent contractors (essentially renting their chair) and are able to decide what rate to charge."

I have hard hair to cut right, crappy stylists leave me with a haircut that looks good for about a week and then immediately my double crown takes over and it's fucking impossible.\n\n100$+ tends to be \"celebrity\" upcharge IMO - where having your hair cut by the specific person/at the specific salon is as valuable as the haircut itself (I.E. being able to say your haircut was done by X person or at X salon)."

You could set a limit order today at $2,500 (which is where the price was at just earlier today) and if you put the $70 back in then you will actually have 2% more ETH. Even if there is no significant dip, you can play the current channel to save dollars and spend crypto. \n\nPeople need to wake up to this because spending with crypto fuels usage. And it is not that hard to sell at market and buy back in lower with limit orders, save some fiat."

With the APY and APR people are getting off their crypto banks will have to adopt to stay relevant. I understand that yes, at the current price this was purchased for 70 dollars and that equals .02 ether. But if you have the 70 cash it would be a far better investment to use the American Shitcoin dollar and not a form of payment worth far more than what it was spent on. Like I said in the previous comments I am happy to see the publicity regardless, I just think it\u2019s a poor financial decision. Makes much more sense to buy and stake and see what the future holds"

And gas fees and tax can be included in price . Never mind that not everyone even has transaction fees . So it doesn\u2019t even effect them and even if it did they could charge it to the company .

Pay twelve dollars and throw in a five for tip. But just an average cut, I wear a hat a lot. \ud83d\ude01Not because of the hair cut! So the price sounds about right if you take into account, location. Glad to see more user end of ETH. Thanks for the post."

Is there a school for mens cuts only?\n\nI go to a place called the Mens Department in Tampa Bay Area Florida, the cuts start at 26 I think and go up depending on which level the person cutting your hair is. The girl that used to cut my hair was up to like 36$. She would literally have killed me if I tried go to to a cheaper person, but why would I your appearance is super important and I know we have all had some bad cuts in our day. I used to go to a local one in high school it was 5$, but was mostly moms from the town with little to no experience or school. Some hack jobs that led to a shaved head many times. With tip mines usually $50, but you can have unlimited free beers if you want lol"

You only have to cut hair around 14k times to be a millonaire which means if you cut a hair in 15 minutes *(which is a good estimate as i can cut mysleves hair in 20 minutes and it is alright and you are a professional)* it only takes 3500 hours to become millonaire with a 8 hour daily job it is 437 days. **So with this price you will be a USD millionair in 1,5 years** *(if we subtract some expenses)*"

I suggest just pitch the idea to some of your regulars.\n\nAnd if they like the plan, also give an option for monthly crypto subs ofcourse! Just set up a new wallet for this shit and accumulate for some years. And then you can build your fkn barber empire with all the gains you got from 8 year old ADA and ETH hahahaha\n\nAnyway good luck bro, wishing you massive luck and gains"

    "body": "My buddy bought 2M Doge in April of 2020 and it cost him like 5K which to him isn\u2019t the end of the world, but also not exactly play money\u2026 he was legitimately interested in the investment\u2026 then got FUD\u2019d up a few days later and pulled at a loss of a couple hundred bucks lol. I was telling him in January that I had bought some when he told me that and I did the math when I pulled my 10x earnings or whatever it was and he would have had like 5Mil I think it was had he just let it sit one year. I feel bad for him, but I mean that\u2019s the game, we all have that \u201coh shit\u201d moment at some point if we do this long enough and we all kick ourselves\u2026 I was trying to invest thousands into BTC when it was a dollar and gave up because I wasn\u2019t tech savvy and every single person I knew that was in any kinda finance at the time told me how stupid the idea was\u2026 also an \u201coh shit\u201d moment that I kick myself for. But there are literally more opportunities just like it every single day with these things and things like it."

    "body": "I am NOT rich and I originally put $4,952 in on Dogecoin at 2 cents. I was told to buy in by a family member on Christmas just two weeks before when it cost less than a penny but I unfortunately failed to listen at that time and instead bought in at the 2 cent mark. I currently have $30k down on SHIB but that $30k was only made into $30k last week. It was just $10k bought in at .00002800 before that. I just do my research. These meme coins aren't just dumb meme coins like people with Bitcoin for example, tend to see. They just see the price and maybe the number of coins available and automatically skip the research where as I am willing to go all in at times on memecoin and each time, I have banked significantly by being willing to do so because I do my research just like you would with any other crypto. You could probably get in on this idea right now, with SHIB and potentially come out very successful soon since there is like 40 billion dollars in support behind this coin right now and it's price predictions are already predicting another decimal point is shaven off the coin here probably within a week or two. I personally think it will reach a penny as well with the burn rate being a thing in play. Maybe not get rich and maybe not today but I think it's coming."

Sold @ $2/share when it tanked. How it went from so high to dropping like a lead balloon scared me. \n\nHad I gone through with my DOGE purchase I would have pocketed about 18k but I got scared off by my previous experience in regards to SNDL volatility. \n\nMy friend bought literally at the peak.

She was wise, she said \"there will something new next year\". \n\nFor the reasons first stated, I passed. VERY happy I didn't have FOMO and become a bag holder."

Four or five months ago wouldn\u2019t have net $2300 to $1.2M.  $23,000 would have netted a return like that 4/5 months ago would net around $1.3M in returns.  Let\u2019s say he bought it at .008805 which was the price of Doge on 01/10/21 if he bought $2300 and sold at .50 he would have net $130,000+ which is right around 5 months range.   Even if he bought in December 22nd at .003788 selling at .50 would net $300,000+ which is an amazing return and nothing to scoff at but not in the million range.  So he either got in earlier than 4/5 months or put more skin in the game to make that kind of number"

As a trader if you are specifically utilizing smart contract flash loans to leverage your trade, and your trade will be temporary- then having physical custody of the crypto shouldn\u2019t be an issue and you should be trading on exchanges with volume, and no fees such as Robinhood or PayPal. \n\nNow I\u2019m not saying I agree with the politics of those two but I do agree with no fees on a quick trade. You are working your ass off to do the quantitative level technical analysis- .50 is still way to freaking high considering these exchanges actually do nothing at all but take your money, and there are plenty of automated markets with liquidity pools and potentially lower fees also. \n\nI\u2019m mostly just making a point that to get exceptional rates on CB pro you\u2019ve really gotta be using some leverage. Both of them are ridiculous and oddly enough there are a few trades I can make on Coinbase that actually have lower fees even with leverage than on CB pro. Their whole system is garbage if you want my honest opinion lol."

However I\u2019m not sure how into crypto you are but you can utilize things like liquidity pools and flash loans to add significant leverage to your trades without collateral so you can get pretty close to these numbers as an average investor without actually having that much leverage. Sometimes opportunities present but you need a bot and it\u2019s got to be FAAAAAST and you have to be willing to sacrifice some profit to have your transaction frontrun! Or know someone who runs nodes and can process your transaction immediately so no mem pools anywhere."

Most exchanges are now sending 1099B out for sales and you are also supposed to include a pdf of the transactions because you are coming up with your own cost basis. \nIf I were you, I\u2019d take my taxes to someone that knows what they are doing and get them amended.\n\nAlso .. how do you enter your cost basis? Date of purchase and sale and and wash loss? All of this info is absolutely required by the IRS. They also require a record of your transactions. \n\nEdit: for important warning for who ever is upvoting that person. \n\nAnd whatever exchange you used has probably cut you a 1099B .. you get a copy and the IRS gets a copy. The IRS software algorithms picks up when a tax return is filed and reported income documents have been omitted. The IRS is going to send you a letter and tell you you left this income off of your return. Because it is not on schedule D with all of the required info and documentation. They will add the gross amount on the 1099B money to your adjusted gross income and they will send you a collection letter demanding that you pay the difference in taxes. Plus any interest and penalties. Now you can pay up or amend your return. But good news .. since it takes the IRS a year or longer to get to this .. current is 2-3 yrs due to Covid.. if you can\u2019t come up with all your proof and paperwork from 2-3 yrs ago .. you will have to pay up. The most you could possibly do is amend and move the amount that you incorrectly put on \u201cother\u201d income.. but with no documentation.. you can very possibly trigger an audit at that point. \n\nThis is not cute or clever. In some very specific situations it is possible that the tax may end up comparable.. but there are a ton of situations where it won\u2019t. Now add in the stress and value time wasted in a long drawn out ordeal with the IRS because you think you are clever. Good luck with that. But you saved $200 by messing up your own taxes. That\u2019s next level genus. /s"

It's pretty much a tax on having to do your taxes.\n\n\nI live in Australia and for a good 15 years now you've been able to do your tax online. It used to require a special app, but they've gotten a lot better lately and it's just a web app now. 90 percent of it is pre-filled, as just about every source of income has to report your earnings direct to the tax office, so the bulk of people log in, look at it, go \"yep\", click submit. \n\nEven if you've got deductions and complications, you can use the online application or get the paper one with 37 pages from the tax office and do it that way.\n\nAbout a week later your return is electronically transferred to your bank account, seeya next year.\n\nIt just seems that in the US, land of the free,  you get nickel and dimed to death with every single thing you do. To the point where the \"nickel and dimed\" phrase is easily recognisable as that happening."
