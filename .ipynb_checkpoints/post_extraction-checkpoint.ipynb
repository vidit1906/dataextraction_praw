      "Comment by dronesclubmember: Two massive losses for Australia and cricket in as many days. Very sad news.\n",
      "Comment by StrongSkill7: We have all heard the expression when it comes to celebrities and sports stars “never meet your heroes”. It stems from a fear that they may not live up to the expectations you have set for them. And in the coming days I am sure many cricket fans out there will read about Shane Warne’s exploits on and off the pitch. However, I wanted to tell my story that you will not read anywhere else.\n",
      "\n",
      "My hero growing up as a child in the glory days of Australian cricket was Shane Warne. He had his flaws. However, I think we all knew him from afar as a genuine Aussie bloke that was warm and open.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I had the opportunity to meet him in the most surreal of ways in 2009, this expectation of him held true. \n",
      "\n",
      "During the 2009 Boxing Day Test against Pakistan, a friend of mine was playing poker late one evening at Crown Casino when he messaged me unexpectedly that he was playing poker with Shane Warne. I was prepared to drop everything I was doing and make my way over to the casino, however my friend told me he was leaving shortly. But he did ask me if I was going to the cricket the next day, which I was. He said to keep my phone on me as we may get the chance to meet him the next day.\n",
      "\n",
      "What transpired the next day is one of the fondest memories I have. \n",
      "\n",
      "My phone buzzes, and my friend tells me to meet him outside the MCC Members. I am with a group of about a dozen people, and get up and say “Off to meet Shane Warne”. One friend of mine has a light bulb moment and gets up and says “I’m coming”.\n",
      "\n",
      "We find ourselves walking up some stairs, and Warney walks out of this room, recognises my friend from the night before and excuses himself as he runs off to the bathroom but assures us he will be right back. \n",
      "\n",
      "Next thing I know I am in the epicentre of what I know to be the sound of my summer growing up as a child in Australia, the Channel Nine commentary box, amongst all these greats of Australian cricket. \n",
      "\n",
      "And then the great man returned.\n",
      "\n",
      "For an hour, we had Warne’s undivided attention. He had no reason to talk to us, but he did. We talked cricket, we talked poker, we watched him jokingly make fun of Simon O’Donnell as he got up from hosting The Cricket Show, mock the spin bowling exploits of a Pakistani player, and talk about all sorts of shit. We were chewing the fat, and it was fantastic.\n",
      "\n",
      "My favourite story was about a hand of poker he played the night before. For any who knows anything about poker, he played an entire hand blind without looking at his cards only to turn over Pocket Aces, and my friend was there to vouch for this story. The man had the golden touch.\n",
      "\n",
      "Afterwards he arranged for us to have a tour behind the scenes of how the cricket broadcast is put together, and even arranged for my friend to meet Richie Benaud and get a few tips from him. \n",
      "\n",
      "That one hour reaffirmed everything I thought about Warney growing up as a child. A genuine warm Aussie bloke.\n",
      "\n",
      "RIP Shane Warne.\n",
      "Comment by machdel: Don’t know if a celebrity death has surprised me as much as this. Fuck, rest well Warney.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whenever I tried to bowl spin as a child, his was the action I tried and failed to emulate. Watched so many videos of him trying to figure out how to do that. Was slightly too young to remember the vast majority of his Test career (maybe for the best as an Englishman), but he was Hampshire captain and at Rajasthan Royals, two teams I followed as a boy. Not that this matters, anyone who loves cricket has suffered a loss.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the greatest to ever do it. My annual 2005 Ashes highlights rewatch is gonna feel slightly different now.\n",
      "\n",
      "The best sportsmen are artists - he’s a wonderful example of that.\n",
      "Comment by Zer0wned1: What the fuck?\n",
      "Comment by wannacreamcake: I'm fucking devastated.\n",
      "\n",
      "I loved and hated watching him bowl against us in equal measure.\n",
      "\n",
      "RIP Warney.\n",
      "Comment by None: Oh my in absolute shock.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm going to tell my one Shane Warne story which I think sums him up. 2006 - as a young kid, I went to Hampshire to watch the county championship game against Lancashire on the last game of the season. It turned into a bit of a farce as the Lancashire players wanted to watch the Ryder cup so they sent out two players who didn't like golf to just dead bat it for the draw. So the game turned bonkers, all 11 players bowled, Michael Carberry started bowling left handed and Warney started running in from the boundary and bowling balls as high in the air as he possibly could.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the end of the game, there were a few kids and a surprising number of journalists around who wanted to interview him as skipper about what had just gone on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the furore, as calm as anything, he said to the journalists, wait 10 minutes, I'm gonna stay with the kids if that's ok and spent a good few minutes with each of the kids signing autographs, taking photos and giving everyone items from the changing room no longer needed as it was the end of the season.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've got a Dimi Mascarenhas glove and Shaun Udal shirt from that day and a photo with Warne that we got framed and is cherished. I've met a fair few cricketers but none were ever as kind as Shane Warne, it said a lot about the man.\n",
      "\n",
      "RIP\n",
      "Comment by IrateWizard: Checked 3 or 4 places hoping it wasn't true, but alas...\n",
      "\n",
      "RIP Shane Warne, a true legend of the game.\n",
      "Comment by pala_: I did not expect this turn of events. Love him or hate him, an absolute giant of the game, and one of most watchable bowlers of all time. The ball of the century I still watch with as much amazement as I did when it was live. The biggest possible stage, the biggest possible personality, and the biggest possible result. As far as single deliveries go, that one will never be beaten. \n",
      "\n",
      "Cricket is better for having had Shane Warne involved, and despite all the hate his commentary gets, is poorer for his loss. His actual analysis and cricket brain were first rate.\n",
      "Comment by rockyrosy: Jesus thats shocking.\n",
      "\n",
      "Im 37 and i too had a mild heartattack last year, wakeup call.\n",
      "Comment by Brokenmonalisa: Since everyone is sharing Shane Warne stories, I'll share mine, it's pretty minor but it sums up how great a bloke this man is. \n",
      "\n",
      "My dad is a pretty massive cricket fan and he used to go to all the matches in Adelaide and would often go interstate if overseas to watch them. He would run into warnie often and my dad would yell out and say hi like he was his mate. Warnie probably didn't know his name but he'd remember him every time and say hi and stop to chat. This \"relationship\" went on for probably 20 years across the globe. \n",
      "\n",
      "My dad will be absolutely shattered.\n",
      "Comment by GrowthhackerAU: I know he did a lot of stuff that was worthy of criticism but I'll always fondly remember my family's memory of Warnie\n",
      "\n",
      "Mum was acting vice principal of a western suburbs (Melbourne) primary school when Warnie returned from his first tour of Sri Lanka. He wasn't the household name that he would very quickly become.\n",
      "\n",
      "He ran a clinic for  Victoria at her school. None of the teachers recognised him. Mum was told that it was \"some nice young bloke called Shane\" who had ran the clinic. Mum was a sports nut and instantly knew who it was. By the time she was told he was on his way out the school.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mum raced out and apologised for the other staff not recognising him. They started to chat.. and chat... and chat. They ended up back in the staff room for a couple of cuppas. They ended up speaking for a good couple of hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mum was very impressed by him and we became huge Warnie fans.\n",
      "\n",
      "I messaged him about 18 months ago and mentioned the events. For everything that he'd experienced in the years since he still remembered that day at our school and said it was fond memory of the teacher who he perfectly described.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rest in Peace, Shane. Mum's already at the ground in the sky waiting to watch you bowl 'em out in the Heavens.\n",
      "Comment by NoBlindsHorse: Shane Warne had a legion of fans in every cricketing country. This is devastating. Colossal loss of not just a cricketer but a great entertainer. Thanks for your presence and time on earth, Champ. RIP\n",
      "Comment by Cheesues: There is no fucking way this is real. What the actual fuck?\n",
      "Comment by None: [deleted]\n",
      "Comment by NiallH22: This has properly hit like a ton of bricks. Awful news.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is going to be a lot written about this man and his cricketing skill and achievements, every word will be deserved, a true all time great of the game with possibly more knowledge on the art of spin bowling than anyone else in the world.\n",
      "Comment by that_introverted_guy: With Warne, it was never about the numbers, it was always \"what more can he do, what other magic can he conjure?\" If you can think of it, he probably can deliver it. Every ball was an event, every spell a journey.\n",
      "Comment by damot55: He was only 52. Life is so fragile. RIP mate.\n",
      "Comment by LesThePinapple: As much as a couldn’t stand and railed against his Fox commentary, it was impossible to deny his love, talent and dedication to our great game. What a shock.\n",
      "Comment by --______________-: He posted about his fitness goals on his Instagram saying how he wants to get back to being fit by July, just 4 days back. And now we hear this. Genuinely shocked. Life is so fragile.\n",
      "Comment by formergophers: I loved to shit on his commentary and half baked takes, he was a goldmine for any self-respecting shitposter.\n",
      "\n",
      "What I didn’t say enough was that he absolutely loved the game and there was a lot of good about him. Watch him during the Sky coaching sessions between sessions of play, and he would be so insightful and incredibly encouraging to the young kids sending in videos and so on. \n",
      "\n",
      "I would often use the phrase “great leggie, shit bloke”, but that is grossly unfair in the cold light of day and there was a lot of good about him.\n",
      "He was an insanely talented, albeit flawed human being and the cricketing world is worse for having lost him.\n",
      "Comment by Cretviones: Yo I'm having a hard time processing this news. Shane Warne, dead? Holy shit, this is the first time a cricketer had died after I knew about them\n",
      "Comment by Sensitive-Pool2514: I don't comment on stuff but my vietnamese wife doesn't understand why her husband is an uncontrollable blubbery mess. \n",
      "\n",
      "Like many of you Warnie was (is) an absolutely giant. Mesmerizing with the ball and absolutely charming away from the popping crease. I could never turn away from the tv when he had the ball in his hands. \n",
      "\n",
      "As a 12 year old boy some 29 years ago when I met my hero I was struck by the time he took to shake us kids' hands on a school trip. He was as patient as we were obnoxious. And yes he was wearing a pork pie hat and happy pants; another reason I will never forget him. \n",
      "\n",
      "Shane Keith Warne was an everymans hero. A battler who came good from humble beginnings and no matter how much we lauded him he stayed relatable. He was too large for this life and like literally hundreds of millions of cricket fans around the world I am so sorry he is no longer with us. \n",
      "\n",
      "Rest in Peace Warnie\n",
      "Comment by SirDoris: Oh fuck, I just woke up in the middle of the night, checked the time and saw this.\n",
      "\n",
      "I mean, Warnie was a weird cunt. But he was our weird cunt. And not just Australia’s weird cunt, cricket’s weird cunt. I can’t imagine cricket without him. Heck, I can’t imagine a match thread without people complaining about his hot takes. He was a one of a kind guy, and he should never have died this young, he should have only grown older and crankier.\n",
      "Comment by mrexperimenter: I can't believe it. It's so shocking! I grew up watching him play. He wasn't that old. He seemed to be in good condition I just can't fathom it's real.\n",

      "I have no stories but I just want to touch on the love for leg spinners in the current game. That 20 minute segment with Rashid Khan was great, he was absolutely fanboying over Rashid's ability to use 6 different grips. And whenever some leg spinner rising up fanboyed over him, he'd catch a flight and be a mentor for him for about a month. Guy loved the game. I loved watching him as a kid.  \n",

      "Comment by jeffvox: I was about 9 when Warne came to South Africa for the first time with the Aussies. We'd all read about The Flipper in newspapers but none of us had seen it. When he pulled it out, I still remember not being able to understand what I'd seen. The replays seemed to make it more, not less confusing. I spent countless hours bowling in my back yard, learning how to reverse my hand position to try and pull it off. Those hours, alone with a tennis ball, trying to manipulate physics, are some of my favorite childhood memories. I watched every second of the man playing that I could because he made you believe that if you looked away, you might miss something truly magical. Thanks for the memories, legend.\n",

      "Comment by MushroomMan89: I'm English. I hated Warne. I hated him in the manner that's the biggest compliment you can pay to an opponent. Every single time he came on to bowl, I had anxiety. But that was watching him, an Australian, and the greatest leg spinner of all time, play against my team. \n",

      "Comment by ProMarcoMug: Some people who haven’t actually played cricket may not realise this but leg spin is probably the hardest skill in the game, it takes a lot to rip the ball from your wrists and do it 100 times a day in a test match and it’s obviously even harder to do this with some form of control and accuracy which is why finger spinners are much more common in the longer format, Warnie was a master of his art, an absolute genius and a very lively character, he could not only spin the ball miles but the number of variations he developed along with his skills of intimidation and deception ensures his impact on the cricket pitch remains unmatched.\n",

Couldn’t give a single shit about the personal stuff, by all accounts he was as weird as a leg spinner ought to be, overcame a lot of bullying without becoming a bully himself, but was a kind human being.

      "And now he was home. This young man had turned leg spin bowling from an antique card trick to a transistorised, full programmable multifaceted arsenal.

So any comparison to Muralidaran are meaningless (Murali operated in a far weaker bowling attack in general), Warne was simply on a different level, and I think he had one of the best cricket brains in the game, as a player he really understood match situations exceptionally well and I think would have made a better captain than Ponting during their overlapping periods...\n",

      "\n",
      "Tl;dr: Ben Stokes is superhuman.\n",
      "\n",
      "There isn't really a direct analogy I can make to any American sports.\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of how England came back, it's like a team coming back from something like 8-0 down with two out at the bottom of the ninth. And this is in the biggest rivalry in the game - think Red Sox v Yankees or even more. If England had lost this game, we'd have no longer had a chance of winning the series against Australia, so there was added pressure.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bigger achievement is what Stokes did as an individual. In cricket, players are more specialised, which means bowlers (pitchers) are generally terrible at batting (and vice versa), so you expect the specialist batters to get most of your runs. Because England had a humiliatingly low total in the first innings, we had a big total to chase in the second to win, literally the highest total we've ever reached to win a test game. Our batsmen did OK, but got out, which left Stokes batting with the bowlers.\n",
      "\n",
      "In cricket, unlike baseball, you as a player bat until you're out and then that's it for the innings, so Stokes knew he was going to have to do it alone with the bowlers. In theory, each batsman faces six balls (pitches), and then his partner faces six and so forth. But you can manipulate this by getting a single run at the right time so that each new series of six balls is directed at the guy you want it to be. It's doable but of course the opposition know that's what you want to do and will try to stop it.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the end Stokes needed to play a near perfect few hours, scoring runs aggressively at great risk, making sure he stayed on strike rather than the non-specialist batsmen he was batting with by getting single runs at the right time, and of course not getting out. And he did this in a huge pressure cooker situation in the knowledge that one mistake would end it all - or that his batting partner might make a mistake on one of the rare balls he faced and make it all in vain. Added to that, batting for so long with effectively no break offered by your batting partner being able to share the load must be mentally and psychologically exhausting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stokes scored 130 or so in these incredible conditions - at the best of times that's like scoring 40 points in basketball with a triple double, but in these conditions it's unbelievable. It's an incredible achievement of skill, strategy and, simply put, balls of steel.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was after he bowled a spell of 24 or so overs yesterday and the day before (like pitching 15+ innings in baseball, maybe, huge risk of fatigue or injury and he kept on bowling really well throughout despite that). He's one of the rare players who can bowl and bat at a high standard, usually it's either-or. He also had a very similar batting performance in roughly similar conditions in the World Cup final about a month ago - what a man.\n",
      "Comment by AnthonyGonsalvez: Not really sure if it is possible to explain it in an ELI5 manner, it is a very rare thing what happened today. This is from a 5 day game, England was losing the game until this guy showed up and won it single handedly for them. He's also the guy who was the key player in winning the world cup for them in June. The series that is being played is called \"Ashes\" and is being played since 1882 between these two teams, has a lot of history,lots of heroic moments and failures. It's like as you say, separates men from boys.\n",

He certainly wasn’t going to die wondering with the last man (also immense credit to Leach for being able to maintain his composure and focus at such an important time in the series) and took the risks only when it was the last option.

Their top order batsmen bowled 4 overs for 9 runs while our batsman (even young ones like Gill & Iyer) think it's below their pay grade to be even handy at the other skill. They have Cam Green and Stoinis on bench who again are both proper all-rounders. Pandya's injury fucked the team balance but Surya had no business being near the ODI squad, let alone the playing XI and fucking Famous Krishna was our backup fast bowler. So this was always coming. Sad that all our weaknesses got exposed in the final. It doesn't help when your wk scores just a single boundary even after playing 100+ deliveries. And only four boundaries in last FOURTY overs. Great campaign till the final though. But based on recent past, hard to see us learning any lessons from this as well.\n",

      "Comment by WayToTheDawn63: It felt almost non-existent. Not like there were as many missed catches as SA in the semis or even a ton of misfields. It just felt low energy. Nothing getting stopped, gaps kept being found for easy singles. I daresay Shami and Bumrah have maybe hidden that fault with their dangerous bowling. It's why you need tough games. Aus clawed their way to the finals, faults and all, but with every game they could patch it up a little. India was never tested enough to be pushed higher.\n",

      "Comment by IAmNotKevinDurant_35: I was really disappointed in the Ahmedabad crowd today. Cricket is meant to be a sport built on respect for your opponent and recognizing heroic performances even if it is at your team’s expense. Even in England during a heated Ashes series, the crowd will cheer a Marnus century or a 5 wicket haul for Starc. I went to a couple world cup matches in Bangalore and it was so refreshing to see a crowd of mostly blue India shirts cheering on every Fakhar Zaman six even though they hate Pakistan in more than just cricket. Travis Head barely got any applause for his century, it was either cheers for India or complete silence. Even during the trophy ceremony they were chanting Kohli’s name lol. Embarrassing stuff\n",

Yes, the rain spoiled almost a whole week of play, which inevitably turned out to be so crucial for some teams in the end. And yes, it stunk that the World Cup wasn't on FTA and so the host country - a MAJOR player in our great game - was very much in the dark about it until the very very end. But, my God, the amount of great games we've witnessed, and the numerous moments of brilliance in each single one, has really been something special...and the final!! Holy mother of God what a FANTASTIC, AWESOME, AMAZING, EPIC, HUMDINGER of a game! What a battle between two nations, with bat AND ball. It all came together perfectly in the end. England 2019 has really set the bar high for India 2023 - which I have high hopes for considering what a success 2011 was (and the World T20 in between as well)...I love test cricket but the World Cup is just something else.

He passed away in 2017 having seen NZ come bitterly close to getting our first major gong (excluding CT) in 2015, yet he always insisted test cricket was the pinnacle.

      "Comment by dogsrock: Alright this is probably the closest I’ll get to this being a relevant time to narrate my love story with Nz cricket.\n",
      "\n",
      "Back when I was 10 or so, cricket was completely my world. Being an introvert and definitely not finding anyone interested in simulating 5-day matches with me, I began shadow batting and simulating hitting the ball against my living room wall. Without Internet those days, my sources were the daily newspapers for scorecards. At that time; the only series that was ongoing was an obscure NZ SL in mid 90s. I faithfully copied out the player names, made my teams and excitedly created my first match scorecard. In my “simulated” match, I pretended to play as NZ and one of my batters got a double ton. The real match had not yet started at this time, btw. The player who got the ton? Bryan Young. And imagine my exhilaration when the real Young actually scored a double ton (and vanished soon after) but I remember him so vividly because in a way I relived his ton. I haven’t shared this with anyone because it was my silly childhood indulgence that mostly no one would appreciate (though dad was because he used to sneak up and look into ny scorebooks :))\n",
      "\n",
      "But I’m sharing it now because that started my journey with a lifelong fascination with the Kiwi team. In every simulation game, I would start off playing as them (even though I’m an Indian and get crushed whenever the Indian team loses). I kept rooting for them in every major ICC tournament, fascinated with how they kept punching  above the weight but somehow not able to make it past the finishing line. I also absolutely loved the vibes at their grounds - the carnival, relaxed crowd, conditions so different from India, and the lack of successes we had touring there. I was absolutely gutted with how it turned out for them in 2015 and 2019 wc. \n",
      "\n",
      "So when I say that I didn’t mind us losing, I’m not saying that just to console myself or appear condescending but I truly felt happy (after the crushing disappointment of my hopes for an unlikely win gone) that after some 25 years from when my fascination started with this team and when they became my 2nd favourite team, it gladdens me to see them earn this absolutely well deserved honour. Congrats to all the fans!\n",

They've got a great bowling department, strong batting and a proper team ethos.  Today underlined why they are a good team, the game could have peetered out into a draw, but they bowled well this morning and then hung in there with the bat against some tricky bowling and got over the line with a few overs left. An 8 wicket win looks like a comfortable victory but it was much tighter in reality. \n",

The 2019 WC final was more dramatic, but this was unmatched in pure cricket quality. I can't get over the fact that everyone wrote a result off, but then NZ took 8 wickets and chased a decent total, all in the reserve day. Win by 8 wickets might not be the barest of margins, but in terms of time it absolutely was - the last hour in a SIX day game.\n",

If I had those two defeats happen to me, I could not have accepted the defeat with the humility and grace that NZ showed. That’s a champions mentality they show then and they were better in these conditions than India and they’ve come a long way with batting.

      "Comment by RedKing_21: Should’ve went for the kill when they were 40 odd for 3. Instead the spinners just came on and the singles were shockingly easy and India never recovered. The batting never recovered after Rohits’ needlessly reckless shot, we were fairly well placed until then. Gill, Iyer, SKY and Siraj were completely redundant today, was legit like playing with half a team.\n",

      "\n",
      "australia handled pressure well. they didn’t make any mistakes not only in the finals but even in the semis, while india on the other hand were sloppy in the field even during the semis (mind you that game was looking like it’ll go down to the wire until we got a once in a lifetime spell from shami)\n",
      "\n",
      "australia did the basics very well. their ground fielding probably saved 15-20 odd runs while their catching, primarily rohit’s won them the match. not to mention their bowlers didn’t release any pressure by giving extras (which again was the opposite for india, not only in the finals but you could see the signs in the semis where bumrah started so wayward you would be hard to believe that it was him bowling)\n",
      "\n",
      "australia did their homework way better than india. they had a gameplan to get every indian batter out. they dangled maxwell to rohit, as soon as iyer came they got pace back on and set him up well. cummins particularly read the game amazingly and immediately adjusted his lengths and fields, not allowing kohli to score anything in the front V, forcing him to play the shot that got him out eventually, unlucky as that might have been. \n",
      "for india on the other hand, they completely, planning was not as great. sending jaddu up the order where he neither rotated the strike nor tried to slog, not having slips while the spinners were bowling on a turning track, and generally not having fallback plans to get head out, who is australia’s biggest match winner and player of the match in 3 big games now.\n",

      "india also completely abandoned the brand of cricket that got them here. the batsmen got into a shell and the bowlers didn’t bowl good lines and length apart from bumrah.\n",

      "Comment by Careless-Opposite-93: Just came here to say one thing, today I respect Gambhir more. His knock is underrated and he should be given more credit for 2007 and 2011. He might be a salty ass but man showed up on 2 big occasions.\n",

      "Comment by _DunnO__o: People are not gonna like to hear this but but big scores are more important than 40s scored at whatever sr in ODI's, you can't win an ODI in PP(it's hard to bat in 10-35overs period), For a team like India which has only 5 batters and Jadeja +Sky, It was going to bite us in the ass at some point. If you are having a good day you have to make it count in ODI like head did today can't expect that others will have good day and leave it on others, it's okay if you score 90 100 120 in 100 110sr it will be always better than 40s in 150 or above sr.\n",

      "Comment by Sans010394: Let's be honest we all love rohit but the way he played today, must deserve criticism. Playing such a reckless shot after scoring 10 runs of that over was not required at that time. After that all that field placements and poor fielding.\n",
      "Comment by No_Animator5200: To be honest, we were too dependent on Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli. Rohit for the starts, Virat to support everyone else while scoring steadily. KL added stability in the middle but Jadeja was never really tested with the bat in group stage and SKY was very mediocre throughout. Gill was yes or no. Iyer’s one big weakness was exploited again, today.\n",
      "\n",
      "240 was never going to be enough. Can’t fault the bowlers much who’ve been good throughout the tournament. Yes, Kuldeep Yadav and Siraj didn’t get enough wickets in the second half of the tournament and a good batting lineup like Australia’s put that weakness on show.\n",

      "And the result is in front of us. \n",
      "\n",
      "India wins lots of bilaterals because of the lack of pressure. It isn't bad if they lose one or two matches. They can always make a comeback. But in a tense situation everyone loses their shit.  A microcosm of how Indian fans cope with pressure situation. \n",

      "Comment by Kaladin12543: While I am sad we lost, Aus were simply the better team today. Their fielding was on point and their batsmen showed intent albeit they threw 3 wickets to achieve that which was risky. \n",
      "\n",
      "IMO every player after Rohit seemed more concerned about protecting the wicket rather than scoring. Head and Lab started firing on all cylinders once they played on that pitch for 100 runs. I never saw that from Virat and KL Rahul. KL Rahul literally didn't do anything except protect his wicket like it was a test match and Virat also slowed down because our lower order was shit. Jadeja didn't do anything and Sky performed poorly. The Aus have a much better lower order with Maxwell, Stoinis and Cummins. The lack of a good lower order meant Virat and KL couldn't unleash themselves like Head. This led to a below par score\n",
      "\n",
      "Then in the second innings, it was clear that our team was simply not used to defending a below par score and that's why I have said we should have lost a couple of matches in the group stages because it teaches you how to bounce back. Here we lost confidence, brought in Shami at the start instead of Siraj, field placement was questionable compared to Aus first innings. We gave so many extras and even Bumrah and Shami started slipping.\n",
      "\n",
      "In comparison, Aus is used to pressure situations with NZ, SA and Afg. India wasn't  \n",
      "\n",
      "Head and Lab performed because of the lower order which is non existent in our team. It came back to bite us in the ass in the finals. You can't always rely on Shami and Bumrah to save the day. A combination of being too good to fail and a lack of a recovery plan when it happens is what cost us the WC.\n",

      "Comment by FondantAggravating68: This is the probably the first match this wc where Rohit's captaincy was dreadful. You can't change your opening bowling combination when its been a solid thing the whole tournament and disrupt the tempo of the whole game. I get Shami was bowling well, but you don't move Virat to open the batting cos he scored 700 runs. Also when you have Marnus who hasn't been great in the wc and Travis head who played and missed a million balls, you attack with the field and not let them settle in.

      "The quality of players were great, but our squad balance sucked ass. I've always said this. With the tail starting at no.8, players can't take the game on freely coz it's always in the back of their heads. Everything is sunshine and rainbows until it works, but with a few quick wickets gone at the top, the middle order is essentially playing to half their potential. Cricket is a mental game.

Look at both soccer World Cup winners, recently, in the group stages, Argentina lost to Saudi Arabia and in the women’s’ WC, Spain lost 4-0 to Japan. There is a mentality then you need to get better rather than playing how you did. Australia were bottom after losing first 2 matches. All this talk of the hometown crowd and pitch favouring India didn’t help either. This actually worker for Australia as they love adversity. As Cummins mentioned, “nothing more satisfying than hearing a big crowd go silent”.

Our fielding and bowling lacked discipline and worse yet somehow we had a very defensive field when Australia needed over 120 runs with 7 wickets in hand. It was like they just wanted Australia to win this slowly. We needed wickets to win from there, we barely tried anything but hoping one of their batters will gift us a wicket somehow. Rohit's batting and his captaincy today were on the extreme ends, he batted like he wanted to win the match in 20 overs, he set his fields like he just wants to lose this after 40 overs.

When I look at the batting depth in 2011 and compare it to the current lineup there's simply no comparison. IMO there is too much emphasis on T-20 and playing attacking cricket from the get go these days and a lot of the newer players just haven't played enough ODIs or Tests. Also, some players just seem to lack patience and start playing attacking cricket from the get go these days and end up throwing their wicket as opposed to starting slow and accelerating once you get to a certain stage.

We're playing an all rounder short and he as the captain knows that better than most. Had to change his strategy and aim to play a longer innings. But I admit you can't blame him only. Gill bears primary responsibility followed by Iyer and SKY and then Jadeja. Can't really blame Kohli and KL because they knew they were the last batsmen there though KL should've ideally hit more when Kohli was also around. Jadeja and SKY managed 27 off 50 which was almost at par with the bowlers (who managed 26 off 39 between the four of them). The rot in our batting started at the top with Gill, Iyer, and, to a much lessed extent, Rohit. It ended with SKY who honestly should be chucked out of this side.\n",

Your team's composition gives you no wiggle room for anything other than excellence from nearly everyone, because you have nobody to pick up the slack. Australia can bat down to Starc and Cummins when necessary. Even Zampa has put in some good scores like 29 from 18 against England. By having more all rounders like Maxwell, Head and Marsh, we can give other teams more variety to face, and save overs for our frontline so we have better choices later, to give the pacers a break, to respond to conditions, or like what happened in the final here. Starc and Hazelwood started expensive, some all rounders spent some overs that alleviated the pressure on Starc and Hazelwood, and they came back and killed it later. We didn't have to keep bowling players that weren't hitting the mark right away. Shami and Bumrah started strong, then got negated and were forced to keep using their overs.\n",

      "Comment by SpeakerMotor1327: bro it's not the bowlers' job, if it was an all-rounder I can agree but we don't have quality allrounders except Hardik and Axar. We don't have to make our batters bowl, our players did everything acc to the roles they were given, that's why we were on a 10 win streak. Only Head is a great batter who can bowl decently. England had all that you said but they couldn't click with batsman who can bowl, bowlers who can bat and so many all rounders. They had batting depth till no 8 or 9 and 6-7 bowlers. We were clinical throughout the tournament and tbh I only blame Sky cuz we picked him based on his selection of shots and his t20i prowess(a bad criteria I agree), he couldn't bat or bowl, he didn't score runs in any game except against England. He was the deciding factor cuz it was a 280-300 pitch and the top order contributed 100 runs in the beginning, in the middle order, Rahul took 106 balls for a 66(can't really fault him cuz he was the last good batter), if sky had scored 40-50 runs we would've put enough runs on the board which could've been salvaged by our bowlers. Dhoni was a flop in the 2011wc but bcuz he salvaged with that Blinder of 90 runs in the final so he was redeemed, that's how crucial middle order runs are.\n",
      "Comment by amluchon: Exactly. We were cruising and SKY's inadequacies were hidden because the batsmen before him managed to get the job done practically every time. Obviously, doesn't take anything away from Australia's dominating performance yesterday - as Shastri put it, we were out played and out thought. You guys realised SKY was a weak link and attacking early and wiping out our strong batters was the way to go even if you conceded some runs in the first PP. Executed it to near perfection with a few things which were down to luck also going your way - Kohli's dismissal being a prime example of that.\n",
      "Comment by amluchon: Absolutely. God knows why they stuck with SKY. Even Ashwin would have been a better pick because that way we'd have a bowling attack with even more options.\n",
      "Comment by WayToTheDawn63: > bro it's not the bowlers' job\n",
      "\n",
      "You won't convince an Australian of that. That's the difference. It's not their job to hit 100's at 150 strike-rates, but they have to be better than walking wickets. Our bowlers have saved or closed so many games with the bat. Even ignoring the WC, Cummins won the game with the bat in the first Ashes test. You want your players doing more. It makes them more valuable. Why count yourself out with the bat at 6-7 wickets? You have 11 of them. I dunno how it is in clubs, Mum never got me in to one, but I can tell you that during analysis and such on Aus TV, former pros tell younger bowlers to pick up a bit, because it could be the reason you win a game. \n",
      "\n",
      "> but we don't have quality allrounders except Hardik and Axar.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kind of what I'm saying. You need to foster the all rounders more. Not saying Aus is perfect here, but we absolutely have a growing culture that players play all parts of the game.\n",
      "\n",
      "> We don't have to make our batters bowl, our players did everything acc to the roles they were given, that's why we were on a 10 win streak.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is what I'm saying though. Your players basically need to perform well every game with little wiggle room because there's no one there to pick up the slack in tougher games. You were on a 10 win streak because you had 10 games where almost everyone was firing very consistently. The final showed you what could've happened at any point if your team *wasn't* firing on all cylinders. Everyone does their one thing. There's no scrappiness when your batters have a tough game. Your bowlers don't fight for the extra 30 runs that might make a difference. Your batters don't get to redeem themselves with a good spell with the ball. If a player got neutralized. They were out of the game. When Aus players get neutralized, you can think of other ways the contribute. Warner is a freak of nature on the field, stopping dozens of runs in boundaries. Labuschagne had a good game, but when he doesn't, he's also a legend of the field. Marsh, Head and Maxwell all bowl. Cummins, Starc and Zampa can all bat okay. There's *fight* there.\n",
      "\n",
      "> Only Head is a great batter who can bowl decently.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marsh hasn't been the best this tournament, but he bowled 2 overs against India and gave up 5 runs total, saving 2 overs for our frontline. Maxwell can't bowl? He's the one who picked up Rohit. Against SA he got no wickets but bowled 10 overs for a 3.5 economy. \n",
      "\n",
      "> if sky had scored 40-50 runs we would've put enough runs on the board\n",
      "\n",
      "Something that Australia has done with their bowlers on good days. That's the power of bat competency even as a full time bowler, you can help salvage games. If your bowlers were just a little more reliable, Rahul might've had a better strike rate. What your players do, they do well, but I think the future (and even the present for us right now) are players that also do more. Nearly half of India's wickets are freebies.\n",

They had to face a lot of naseem, shadab and rauf in the middle overs as Pakistan were searching for wickets, and they all bowled well. There was an element of stokes getting bogged down by hitting fielders and good bowling, but also knowing wickets were the most important thing and they’d be able to score in the last 5 vs the weaker bowling with batsmen to come. Stokes didn’t actually give many chances, despite some false shots. In the end, 2 boundaries off the spinner killed the game, which says a lot about how far behind the rate england really were. Best thing was stokes didn’t panic when he wasn’t timing the ball well, found ways to rotate strike and stay in the game. No bonus points for finishing the game early\n",

I don’t think babar got his tactics wrong really; Pakistan needed wickets and so needed to keep bowling naseem (who bowled excellently) and rauf as they looked most threatening. Sometimes though you have to try and ‘steal’ an over or two with bowler number 6 or 7 to give yourself more options at the end; I think England do that really well with stokes and Livingstone (he was expensive today but bowled well vs India). There’s a chance it would have released some pressure, but maybe also it would have baited England into being aggressive against the all rounders and losing a wicket. \n",
      "\n",
      "Not doing any of that left them needing to use essentially the 5th option, wasim, at the death, which England were aware of and I think felt they could take advantage of. It also meant they were highly reliant on shaheen bowling those last two, which of course he wasn’t able to do. Pakistan were left without a seamer to finish that over, which felt like a mistake. Im not really  criticising Babars captaincy, I just think it’s a fairly minor flaw in the balance of Pakistan’s team that got exposed due to unfortunate circumstances\n",

On a phone screen, it almost looks like a different trophy without those side supports. The shadows go over the faces of the both captains and it sucks.

And just like those 2 matches, the team who held their nerves till the end eventually won the match, this time by 4 wickets! 😎\n",
      "\n",
      "At one of the biggest cricket stadiums around the world MCG, with an attendance of 90,000+, today's match took all viewers for a rollercoaster ride of emotions throughout the match. Winning the toss on a fast & bouncy track, Rohit didn't hesitate to bowl first, trying to take advantage of the initial overcast conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a one run tight first over by Bhuvi, the young speedster Arshdeep rocked the stadium when he trapped Babar Azam plumb in front for a Golden Duck, on his very first delivery in a Worldcup. On his second over he again created an opportunity when Rizwan trying to push on a delivery ended up dropping just short in front of a diving Kohli at mid on. But in the very next delivery Rizwan perished trying to pull a short delivery, caught by Bhuvi at fine leg.\n",
      "\n",
      "After 4 overs, Pakistan were 15/2 & has already lost their most prolific run getters in this format. But then instead of giving 1 more over to the bowler who already got 2 wickets in 2 overs, Rohit asked Shami & Hardik to bowl which allowed Pakistan to come back into the game with a 76 run 3'rd wicket partnership between Ifthikar & Shan Masood.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pakistan were 60/2 after 10 overs. In the 11'th over Ifthikar hits their first six of the match against Ashwin. 12'th over bowled by Axar Patel was taken to the cleaners by Ifthikar with 3 huge sixes, producing 21 runs in that over & also provided the much required momentum for Pakistan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Eventually Shami provided the much required breakthrough by trapping Ifthikar 51(34) for an lbw. On the 15'th over a mishit by Shan which went up, hit the spyder cam & dropped in no mans land. It was declared a dead ball but was really a chance for a wicket for India.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hardik produced 3 crucial wickets and restricted the momentum in the middle overs. After 16 overs they were at 116/6. On his 2'nd spell Arshadeep took Asif Ali's wicket & Pakistan were just 125/7 after 17 overs. But with he help of Shan Masood's unbeaten 52*(42) & some lusty blows from the bowlers towards the backend of their innings, Pakistan eventually scored 159/8 in their 20 overs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unlike the way Indian openers started their innings in the last match against Pakistan in the Asia Cup, where they showed intent, this time around had a much sedated start, maybe because of the bitter experience we had in the last T20 Worldcup against the same opponents. \n",
      "\n",
      "Both our openers started cautiously and in the 2'nd over KL Rahul 4(8) played on against Naseem while trying to steer an incoming delivery. On the 4'th over Rohit 4(7) nicked a Rauf's probing outswing delivery to the keeper. India were 17/2 after 4 overs. SKY 15(10) after scoring two good boundaries against Rauf, tried a ramp shot against a quick, short delivery, got cramped for room & gloved it to the keeper.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the very next over, Axar Patel who was sent ahead of Hardik got run out & India were reeling at 31/4 after 7 overs. At that moment the Win Predictor showed Pakistan 85% & India 15% chances to win this match. Right after the powerplay Babar introduced spin from both ends which allowed Kohli & Hardik to slowly start building a partnership, which eventually became the crucial one (113 runs) for India.\n",
      "\n",
      "After 10 overs, India were just 45/4 & needed another 115 runs in just 60 deliveries with 6 wickets in hand. Pakistan had earlier scored 99 in their last 10 overs, but against such a potent Pakistan bowling attack this target looked daunting. India were looking for a big over to get the momentum going & they got it on the 12'th over bowled by Nawaz, which was hammered by Hardik (2 sixes) & Kohli (1 six) for a 20 run over.\n",
      "\n",
      "With that momentum from Nawaz's 20 run over, Virat & Hardik started scoring 9-10 every over to keep the required runrate around 10-11. But Rauf on his 2'nd spell bowled another tight over giving only 6 runs, including 2 run byes & a wide. Needing 54 from 4 overs Naseem Shah bowled another tight over for just 6 runs. Hardik seems to be struggling against those quick hard length & slow bouncers by both Rauf & Naseem.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now needing 48 from just 18 deliveries & last 2 overs producing only run a ball, Indian fans in the stadium seemed to have lost their hopes & were mostly subdued. But Virat & fate has other things planned!\n",
      "\n",
      "First delivery of the 18'th over by Afridi was pulled disdainfully by Virat to the midwicket for a one bounce four. Virat scored two more boundaries in that over bringing a total of 17 runs from that over. 19'th over, Rauf bowled quick & Hardik was struggling for his timing & wasn't able to find a boundary for a long time now.\n",
      "\n",
      "We needed 28 runs from last 8 deliveries & then Kohli pulled a delivery above his chest high over the bowlers head for a mighty six over long on, which was an unbelievable shot & also by far the best shot of the day, that too against their best bowler who was bowling close to 150 kmph throughout. Virat followed that by another massive six, flicking Rauf over the square leg. We now needed 16 from last 6.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the first ball of 20'th over, Hardik 40(37) miscued a mighty heave against leg spinner Nawaz & got caught. As per the new rules, despite crossing over, new batsman has to take strike, after been caught. Dinesh Karthik took a single which brought the inform Kohli on strike. Kohli scored a 2 on 3'rd ball & the equation was now 14 from 4. Next delivery Virat scored a six against a full toes which was later called a 'No Ball' because of 'above waist' height. Suddenly we needed just 6 of 3. \n",
      "\n",
      "Next ball was a wide. So the 'Free Hit' for No Ball still stayed. Virat got bowled on the free hit but the ball ricocheted on the stumps & went down towards 3'rd man & we ran 3 runs. Now needing only 2 from 2, DK tried for a expansive sweep & got stumped. Ashwin now need to score 2 runs from the last ball but Nawaz fired one down the leg side for another wide. Ashwin scooped the last delivery over long off for a historic win by 4 wickets, a sweet revenge especially after that debacle in the previous version of T20 Worldcup. 😎\n",
      "\n",
      "I've never seen Virat Kohli so emotional in his entire career. The way he punched the ground after the win says what this innings meant for him, especially after that lean patch of more than 2 and a half years. Rohit was seen lifting Virat on his shoulder after this unbelievable win. It was evident that, it's only because of King Kohli's brilliance, we have won this match from the clutches of defeat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cometh the Hour, Cometh the Man! This is indeed the return of the King Kohli which we have seen multiple times till 2019 & boy didn't he lit up this Worldcup with his innings today? Virat was rightfully adjudged the Man of the Match for his brilliant 82*(53). 😎\n",

But he was still indias best batsman in this World Cup. They have to pick ipl performers plus experience. According to that they made a balanced team. But just didn’t work out. India actually struggled against all the strong teams this World Cup. Win against pak was a miraculous win only cuz one of the greatest batsman played the best innings of his life. That’s what it took to beat pak. And such innings happen a couple of times in a career, so obviously the chances of that happening again in this World Cup were next to none. Then lost against SA, almost fumbled against Bangladesh, who were cruising along until the rain. So only teams india beat comfortably in group stages were the associates basically.

      "I'm not gay but I want to live in a log cabin in the woods with Cummins. We won't ever have sex, but there will be a simmering erotic undercurrent as I stand in the kitchen window watching him tighten his ass as he chops wood, shirtless, sweat pouring off his body. I'll run upstairs and masturbate, the entire time forcing myself to think of women while my thoughts drift back to Cummins. I won't be able to climax and I'll eventually go back downstairs, angry. Sometimes we will look across the table and catch each other's eyes, and in that second, anything is possible, but we both deny ourselves and go back to what we were doing. One day one of us will die, and the other will bury him outside the log cabin. Then they'll go inside, pen a brief missive to their departed friend, and commit suicide, never able to deal with life without their one true platonic love.\n",

The fight and doggedness of the Indian team is one to be revered and celebrated. To keep putting up those performances when your backs were against the wall was awesome. Loved watching young talent like Pant, Washington, Thakur being thrown to the wolves and responding in kind. Be easy to wilt under those pressures.

But in a series where so many folks put their hands up to be counted, it had to have a fairy tale ending. Last couple of hours the test match resembled a T20 match looking at some of the outrageous shots played. I dont know if this can ever be topped.

In case Pujara is not fully fit I expect Hardik Pandya to play and that would be super exciting as well. In Gill/Rohit India has a destructive opening pair who can take away the game very early. Pant/Jadeja or Sundar in the middle order will ensure India can always make a strong comeback. I want to see Kohli at his very best when he scores a century every other test. Bumrah/Ishant/Siraj/Shami/Shardul makes for amazing fast bowling team while Ashwin/Jadeja pair will ensure India has strong spin team as well. Sundar can play for one of the them if required. \n",

This team has 2 key players in Smith/Marnus but they need 5/6 to have strong players to get back their past glory. I think focus should be on strengthening first class platform.

So many times out there we look absolutely deflated in the field trying to do the same shit over and over again with no results. There was such a massive contrast in the field when we were out there compared to India. Also, Paine, I like you as our captain, you have done a lot for Australian cricket in terms of transitioning away from our toxic past, but please for the love of god control your emotions out there. It's such a bad look when you slip back into this toxic as fuck 'boys club' mentality and put it on display for everyone to see.\n",

As is so often the case we were carried with the bat by Labs and Smith and came up 50-100 short on good wickets too often to just shake off as some bad luck. We all know the name that's going to come up the most and that's Wade, he hasn't changed or grown and I think has his final strike against him, most of the collapses in the past 4+ years have him right in the middle of them either not reading the situation right or just incapable of getting started. The big problem going forward is I don't see any obvious replacement knocking the doors down. An opening partner for Warner is still a ? Puc looks great but unfortunately until he's proved he can remain fit and available we can't stop that search. I think our bowling cartel deserves a pass for 'flat' performances reeling in the damage from a weak show with the bat (barring Patty who was outstanding as always) but you can't get 20 wickets without challenging the stumps more, resting Starc for certain pitches/tests might be a good strategy going forward too, fatigue of some sort seemed to really be affecting him this match and I'm sure its been asked but what happened to his yorkers? Tim Paine missed a crucial stumping today and has put down catches in previous matches, I haven't even looked at how many byes we leaked, he saved our bacon in the 1st innings of the series and is our captain but I think its justifiable questions are starting to be asked.  \n",

      "Really sad we didn't get to see Bhuvi or much of Ishant or Jadeja this series but fuck me if there isn't a landslide of names breathing down their necks for future tours. Pant was man of the series IMO and it's been so great watching him come up through IPL and hopefully now undoubtedly into a permanent role in the test squad. Pujara hopefully has silenced the more sane critics he has after playing a huge role not only in todays win but in the ability to draw in Sydney.  Washington and Thakur and Siraj are incredibly promising. Honestly even if the next BG trophy was in Australia again I am not confident we could regain it.  \n",

I felt we got ourselves in good positions to win the last two tests through different times but just couldn't execute.

There is still a lot of merit in having a left hand bowler and even though he has had a poor series maybe it was worth keeping him. IMO Lyon got a bit unlucky not to pick up a couple more wickets. Not he’s best series but didn’t bowl terribly. As good as we say our bowling stocks are I really don’t think  Neser is quite test quality and after seeing swepson bowl in the limited overs, don’t think he has enough control for the test format. Not denying his success in shield so far, just don’t think he’s up to the quality of the others. Well played to the Indian side. As much as I’m still an advocate for Paine, can’t help but feel he’s keeping really let us down in the last two tests.\n",

      "When people think of commentators , there are a few names that come to mind immediately. Benaud, Lawry and Greig are often cited as some of the most influential and brilliant. Today, I’d like to make a compelling argument for Athar.\n",
      "\n",
      "Athar may be is not so popular on the commentary scene, but his commentary is already one of the most anticipated, awaited and talked about. As he said in an interview with Wisden, “it’s not really a story – it’s a lifestyle”.  In one of his commentary gig he said - “Bangladesh have not been invited to tour Australia for many years, not even in England. We’re the U19 World Champions. Do they have any fear of playing with Bangladesh? “, Athar effortlessly roasts PIG3 teams with his fantastic tongue in cheek humor  with sharp social commentary on the injustice prevalent in the cricketing world exposing fear of England/Australia to the dominance of Bangladesh team over cricket.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another instance when  Mushfiqur gets knocked over by a bouncer, he praised the batter by saying “Beautifully played”, Athar establishes his intellectualism with advanced knowledge of cricketing technique that would even challenge the likes of Gavaskar, Tendulkar or Greg Chappell. Then another time by saying  “wow helicopter is flying hard to make the security tight whooo” he manages to be both excited at the sight of a helicopter and appreciative of pilots capability to fly the helicopter “hard”. It’s as innovative as it is brilliant.\n",
      "\n",
      "His commentary is filled with some of the most ingenious lines I have ever heard. Perhaps the finest moments in his commentary comes where he shows his unbiased nature. By choosing to not stay silent and open his mouth at every instance, Athar shows a knowledge of synonymous parallelism that is only rivaled by the Benaud.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, his commentary is an allegory for triumphing over society. These days, it seems the world is on fire. By continuing to commentate despite criticism from listeners and fans, Athar says that he is not only unfazed by the world, but is unfazed by life in general.\n",
      "\n",
      "So what does this mean for society? How will his commentary affect a society rotting with corruption, violence, and infighting? The honest answer is not much. Rather, his commentary will act as a beacon to the weary soul. When one is lost in a sea of flames, searching for beauty and meaning, they need to just remind themselves of Athar’s wise words and continue on their merry little way.\n",

Will there be accountability for this loss within the board, team management, team? Will some heads roll? Will some people be phased out or are there too big egos to be sidelined? The team's performance is resembling England's in football. Has a world class Premier League but fails as a nation at the big stages. Two things will be bothersome now. The junta giving gyaan on LinkedIn and Hotstar employees reminding us of viewership numbers. No offence to anyone, but I do have emotions.\n",

Pujara and Rahane are on their way out, and there's no one else apart from Pant and Bumrah whose place is assured in the side.

An absolutely top-drawer piece of alpha shithousery and every media outlet responding with \"Classy touch 👏 👏 👏\" So many elements to it. Even India surely can't believe their luck with how far Lyon has to walk to get it. All puts me in mind of every Partridge studio set, where everything is slightly too far apart and every walk across it takes an excruciating few seconds too long.Then there's Rahane summoning him to collect it when he obviously doesn't want to. Respect for Rahane through the roof here.Love to know whose idea this was, and also whose idea it was to force Lyon to come and collect it and have to be gracious in front of everyone. Because that's what really elevates it.  The \"Classy touch\" would just have been to give it to him in the rooms. This is shithousery ingeniously masked as classiness. Which is brilliant in and of itself.But especially so here because shithousery under cover of classiness is the precise trick Australia have tried and so spectacularly failed to pull off since Cape Town. Winning the series was quite good too, I suppose.\n",

Pakistan suffer a thumping defeat against their rivals in the first match and the tournament looked over. Through an injury to Wahab Riaz and a powerful outing against SA, they not only clawed their way back but thumped their way into the final against tournament favourites, England. Rameez still stands by his heart, picks Pakistan to beat arch rivals in the final. Again mocked (by some) and now he finds his team in the box seat. Unbelievable stuff! \n",

Absolutely thrilled for Waggers, who bowled like an utter champion unchanged for what felt like forever and had so, so many close chances go down. Gutted for Anderson but someone had to be the last wicket. Henry beating the bat at will early on, Southee with the magic touch, Root never looking like getting out until he did, Harry a class act in accepting the (well-deserved) player of the series after a stinker of a day...just an enthralling day from start to finish. Great support for the English at the ground (cheers to the Barmy Army for creating some atmosphere. We, um, seem to struggle to do that at times), and good vibes overall - you can be competitive without the need for bad blood. Still buzzing, man. What a day.\n",

      "Comment by ExtremeSlothSport: Each team has 10 outs (in cricket they're called wickets), the entire list of 11 players bats until there's only one person left, then that's the end of an innings. You win when you've scored more runs than the other team after they've batted twice. Normally the innings order goes Team A 1st innings, Team B 1st innings, Team A 2nd innings, Team B 2nd innings.\n",
      "  \n",
      "So in this match:  \n",
      "\n",
      "England batted first and got to 435-8 (435 runs for the loss of 8 wickets) but then declared their innings to be over (that's why their score reads 435-8d). That means they think they've scored enough runs and want to make sure they have enough time to get the other team out twice.  \n",
      "  \n",
      "In reply, New Zealand was all out for 209 in their first innings. That was a really bad score. In test cricket, if the team batting second is still at least 200 runs behind, then they can be made to immediately bat their second innings if the first team chooses (this is called \"enforcing the follow on\"). So instead of the order of batting being [Team A, Team B, Team A, Team B] it goes [Team A, Team B, Team B, Team A]. There is a lot of history and controversy about whether or not enforcing the follow-on is a good idea. In theory the team fielding is using more energy because all eleven players are on the field in the sun running around all day, so having two innings in a row doing that can be mentally and physically exhausting. Statistics would suggest, however, that it's an overwhelmingly good idea (before this match it had happened 296 times in test history. The side enforcing the follow on had won 232 times (78.38%), Lost only 3 times (1.01%) and there had been a draw 60 times (20.27%). [nb draw doesn't mean tie, it means no result]  \n",
      "  \n",
      "So England enforced the follow on [that's why it says 2nd innings (f/o)], meaning New Zealand had to immediately bat again. They did much better in their second innings, reaching 483, which meant England needed to score 258 to win. But they were all out on 256, so they lost by 1 run. If they had scored 1 more, it would have been a tie. If they had scored 2 more, they would have won.  \n",
      "  \n",
      "This is only the 4th time a team has enforced the follow on and then lost the match. It's also only the second time a team has won by 1 run. Test cricket has almost 150 years of history, and there have been almost 2500 matches played, so it's an incredibly rare feat and one of the most remarkable matches played in my life time.  \n",

New Zealand didn't reach 400 across both innings *combined* in any of the three Tests, Australia set >400 in all three of their first innings, and declared in all three of their second innings. It's hard to market a rivalry when those are the results.\n",

      "Comment by CricketKieran: They confirmed Jamieson won't be fit for the Sri Lanka series I think. Otherwise I'm pretty happy with that squad. If they didn't want to play a spinner but they wanted an all rounder I would go with Nathan Smith. Otherwise I reckon it's time to develop Ravindra. I couldn't understand bracewellls selection from the start. Like, he's an upper order batter and part time bowler. If you want a spin bowling all rounder surly Michael Rippon is the best. His average with the bat wasnt much lower than bracewells and his bowler was significantly better, but whatever. Shame we'll never get to see rippon in whites probably. And it was only a year ago they were picking ravindra then they turned their back on him and went to an old guy instead of the future. They did the same with Kuggelijn and Duffy. Duffy should have played that Bay OVAL test. You Don't go into a day night test with one swing bowler, but they did. Duffy should have played. He's the top wicket taker this season and is 28. Plus they selected him on the last test tours to England, yet they turned their backs on him too to go with old guys who will probably only ever play 2 tests. It's like they can't see the future at all\n",
      "Comment by CricketKieran: I understand keeping Nicholls. I mean, following the team over the past year Nicholls has easily been the worst batter. Young has been a bit of an unfortunate story. He was only dropped because Conway was so successful and the selectors put Young into open as a result until they found exactly where Conway fitted in. Young also wasn't really an opener to begin with. So Young has been in and out all the time. Yes he has had little success so far, he deserves another go. He's not going to get any better if he doesn't play. I think we've seen the same with Matt Henry. Best bowler on the domestic scene but couldn't get a game until now. When he did play he didnt do much until now, since he's actually playing a lot and he's gotten settled into the test team. Nicholls is a quality player but I think he is pretty out of form, and for the Sri Lanka series he would be the one I'd drop. Young can have 2 more tests, if he fails maybe Nicholls comes back or we go to the younger guys like Phillips or Ravindra, and if you don't want to play a spinner maybe Nathan Smith could bat 7 - pity Dean Foxcroft isn't eligible for NZ yet. He's going to be huge when he play internationally. But Nicholls needs runs, and he's been pretty bad in the last year, and his spots been under threat since the Headingly test last year. It's just Young hasn't gotten to do much because he's not being given the opportunities. At some point the future does need to be developed. Why not prepare him now and get Phillips in there full time before the next WTC cycle begins.\n",

      "Comment by ameyzingg: This is going to be an unpopular opinion but the fact is both govt and people are tired of COVID *and* the lockdowns/social distancing. People showing up in numbers at the stadium despite knowing all the risks itself is indicative of that. For how much time y'all think the govt is going to make people sit at home? Its been an year since pandemic began, there hasn't been a respite from it whatsoever and its starting to affect people mentally especially in a country like India where people are more social. Social distancing was a foreign concept in India even before COVID happened, anyone who travels in public transportation knows this very well. Although cases are increasing recently, India is pretty much at a point where people have developed herd immunity and vaccinations are ramping up too. Even during the peak, recovery rate in India was close to 94% which was phenomenal compared to rest of the world. The fact is COVID is going to stay here forever and we'll have to get used to it. Did OP leave the stadium right away after knowing that there were so many people for the game? I don't think so.\n",

The crowd weren’t just BJP supporting Gujaratis, there were people from all over the world. I personally know several who went there all the way from the US for the finals. They reported back saying that while the crowd was silent, people didn’t shy away from enjoying themselves. And legacies are built overtime. There are blots on the Mumbai crowd as well which at one time booed Sachin Tendulkar and of course Eden garden has its own bit of legacy worth forgetting. Nevertheless, the crowd was silent and demoralized because the Australian team ensured that the crowd remain demoralized. They never let India and the crowd get into the game.

We won't ever have sex, but there will be a simmering erotic undercurrent as I stand in the kitchen window watching him tighten his ass as he chops wood, shirtless, sweat pouring off his body. I'll run upstairs and masturbate, the entire time forcing myself to think of women while my thoughts drift back to Shami. I won't be able to climax and I'll eventually go back downstairs, angry. Sometimes we will look across the table and catch each other's eyes, and in that second, anything is possible, but we both deny ourselves and go back to what we were doing. One day one of us will die, and the other will bury him outside the log cabin. Then he'll go inside, pen a brief missive to his departed friend, and commit suicide, never able to deal with life without his one true platonic love.\n",

But other than the openers today all the rest of the wickets were a consequence of NZ being under massive run rate pressure and having to force the issue. Kane’s wicket in particular. From a technical point of view I thought Shami bowled much better in the pool match vs us than he did in the semi. Still an excellent feat in a semi though.

Sad that r/DeathrattlePorn didn't get any content from their most contributing member. KL Rahul is getting better day by day. All those swinging edges are not easy to take but he makes look all so smooth. All the members are having a crazy World Cup, but some are definitely shining more than others. Shami, Iyer, KL Rahul. These three have performed above expectations. Kohli and Rohit have been playing their natural game. Gill has been good but he himself said he hasn;t been able to convert. Sky had one good innings but has been solid in fielding. Kuldeep hasn't gotten a lot of wickets but is enjoying the economy. Bumrah too hasn't gotten a lot wickets. Siraj has been a hit or miss. \n",

      "Comment by RogueKnight2005: People in India think that guys is 35 years old coz he is playing since 2008!! He's actually only 32 and he has been India's lead bowler. However good Bumrah and Shami are , Ishant was the only guy who was dependable since then. Ik that Bumrah and Shami are better Bowlers than Ishant but he's the one holding the whole bowling attack together. He's like the glue who might not be that important but if he isn't there then there is additional pressure on the other 2 bowlers. He's like Pujara , around whom the entire Indian batting line up revolves. Though Virat and Jinx are better , he's the one shielding the middle order from damage.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I want to add a point here that Virat always admired Ishant Sharma. If u remember in 2014-15 tour of aus , Virat was handed the test captaincy. India were absolutely thrashed in that series. After that series when Harsha Bhogle went and talked to Virat while they were in the airport, Virat had said that the next time India is going to Australia in his captaincy , his team is going to have 3 fast bowlers where all can bowl 140+ and not give away easy runs. And then he said that there's one already here (pointing at Ishant wo was beside him) and India needs to search for 2 more proper fast bowlers who can take 20 wickets against australia in Australia. \n",

I am judging what I've seen and what he's done so far, like every single person does. I never said he can't improve, I never said he'll never be a good test spinner. I said right now he isn't and that India have better spin bowling options - which is about as close to an objectively true statement as possible - and that his main value at this point is what he does with the bat.\n",
