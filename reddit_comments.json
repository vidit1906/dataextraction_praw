(almost, at some point there is always someone who can make a difference in some way, starting small, but smart)\n\nIt's like an empty Christmas present: but a big one wrapped in a beautiful, shiny paper...\n\nThe goal isn't the money, but what the money can be traded for.\nCapitalism is a system (or way of (not) thinking) where the goal is money itself."}

Business wants good or the best employees. That means paying and treating good employees well. Tech companies for example,  invest a ton of money into employees... which means it's in the company's interest to retain them (or lose the money invested, leading to lower profits).\n\nOn the other hand, treating employees like shit (and having that reputation) leads to people leaving, company operations disrupted, company goals missed, potentially losing to competitors, lower stock value and thus... owners and managers making much LESS money than they could have.\n\nAlso, raw materials and labor are =major cost centers so a good business person has to maximize utility with them. If they don't then (1) they are losing money and potential profit, and (2) will lose to competitors who do maximize them, and (3) go out of business.... therefore, not making any money.\n\nGo to the most successful businesses and they get high marks from employees, who also get high salaries/benefits.\n\nAs far as eating money-- Edibility doesn't matter. There are many productive things that I cannot eat. My computer is productive and I can't eat it. A house is useful and I can't eat it. Societies that productively allocate private capital/labor for profit (capitalist) never have had to eat money. \n\nThere are flaws in the monetary system and they are directly caused by the government monopoly on money and collusion with banks, not businesses in general."}

Buterin, that realize that 'money' (be it fiat, crypto or bare gold) is nothing more than a practical exchange item. It has no value on it's own. \n\nUnfortunately the so called capitalistic approach tries to ignore the source of our well being: labour, resources of raw materials, services, ... and a lot of people talk like having money is being rich. Try eating money when you're hungry and you will see what I mean. There's an age old story about a king who wished everything he touches turned into gold. He died shortly after his wish was fulfilled...\n\nI hope in deciding the future development of Ethereum, decisions will plain ignore the ideas of those who are in Ethereum pure as a money gaining investment. Decisions should be made to make the Ethereum blockchain as useable and practical as possible. \n\nIf you look at Bitcoin on this moment: the value has risen not because it became so practical, but because it is failing. It is impossible that all the money pumped into BTC will ever get exchanged back to fiat. And I would not even think about accepting BTC as a means of payment for any goods or services I sell either.\nKnowing that Bitcoin is no more than a means of exchange (for goods or other currency), everyone who is only a little sane can smell what will happen, unless Bitcoin can solve the problem of slowness & high fees in a very short term. If only a few people would have invested in bitcoins this wouldn't be a problem, but senseless 'popularity' drawed so much attention of people who actually have no clue, and only a few will make 'profit' at the end. Profit that in fact serves no one except those few...\nRemember the economic value of something is nothing more than the price the biggest fool wants to pay for it... the real value is something you can't push.\n\nThe real value is only there if you can exchange the currency (fiat/crypto/anything else) for something you actually need. As long as it's a number in a graph, you can cheer as much as you want, you only cheer about air (well, actually about 'ether'/void, as air is something you actually need).\n\nI hope the value of ETH will not rise the same way as bitcoin and instead it will become (or stay, imho;) the best worked out blockchain tech around (mainly due to it's founders actually having a view on how the world turns around). I see blockchain technology as an immature thing right now. Promises a lot, but we are not there yet. I hope mr. Buterin will keep up with the good work and will be able not to get demotivated by those who see Ethereum just as a method of gambling."}

I see where you're coming from I think, but I don't think the real world is really like that. I mean to an extent it certainly is. There really are job creators who make great stuff and we all benefit. But to assume that that accounts for an entire economic system doesn't take the whole picture into account.\n\n> This way, the people who make the most people's lives better will have the most money, and the people who do the least for anyone else will have the least money.\n\nThis is the part where you lose me. We can argue about how big a factor inheritance is, but let's assume for the sake of argument that everyone is on perfectly equal footing to begin with. The people who get the most money aren't necessarily the ones who are best at producing things that people value. They're just the best at acquiring money.  To find an example of something that makes lots of money but doesn't actually produce something positive for society, just look at the myriad ways poor people are preyed upon: pay day loans, rent-to-own furniture and electronics, the lottery, pyramid schemes... Sure, people value this stuff, but the fact that somebody wants to spend a lot of money on something doesn't necessarily mean it's a good thing to spend money on or that it contributes positively to society. You can say that people who blow all their money on renting a stereo system at a high interest rate deserve to be poor because they did it to themselves, and you might be right, but the point stands that the guy who owns Rent-A-Center isn't rich because he's the best at producing value to society. He's rich because he's good at acquiring money.\n\nAnd to the point about government interference, what about the recent vote by the senate to prevent class action suits being filed against banks? Without class action suits, people are forced into arbitration, which is great if you're a bank trying to keep as much of your money to yourself as possible. Wealthy people like to maintain and expand their fortunes; you're absolutely right about that. Papa John wants his pizzas to taste good so that people will continue to buy them from him. But rules like \"no class action lawsuits\" don't benefit the whole society. They only benefit the people already at the top."}

It has, however, been my experience that the overwhelming majority of Redditors prefer not to think. And ok here's the short version. You cannot be rich if all you've got is money. Venezuelans have buckets of it but it doesn't do anything for them because it cannot buy them very much. What you really need to improve your life is not money, it's stuff. Money can be traded for stuff, but only if that stuff exists in the first place. The best way to get stuff to exist is just allow people to make as much of it as possible, and allow people to transfer value to them if they provide some stuff that people want. This way, the people who make the most people's lives better will have the most money, and the people who do the least for anyone else will have the least money. Obviously with things like inheritance and gifts, this isn't exactly true, but it's a pretty close approximation. I hope this makes sense so far. That's about half of it. The second half is why it's better this way than taking from the productive for the benefit of the unproductive. \n\nThe reason it's better this way is that the people who already have the most money in society will usually seek to increase their wealth (and indirectly increase wealth inequality) by leveraging their existing wealth in the production of yet more highly demanded goods. These wealthy people generally tend to want to maintain and expand their fortunes so they have a massive incentive to maintain the quality and quantity demanded by consumers of whatever they produce. If they are producing something people don't want, they will quickly discover that whatever resources utilized in that line of production can make them more profit in another line of production that is actually demanded by consumers. As long as there is no government interference with this system, it's impossible for anybody to get rich without benefitting lots of people on the way, even if it was never his intention to help anyone besides himself. The amount of money they'll have compared to lowly wage workers will be astounding. But it will not be out of proportion with the magnitude of the positive impact they've had on the lives of consumers through providing cheap and high quality goods. This ensures that anyone helping themselves must first help others, instead of the other way around. Redistributing wealth takes from some to give to others, instead of both parties benefitting. This sows the seeds of division and stratifies society much more concretely than voluntary interaction alone ever could. If you want to help poor people the most, you should seek not to punish the rich, but to make it as straightforward as possible for the poor to be as productive as they possibly can, so that their real wages are higher and they can have more stuff, not just more pieces of paper.\n\nObviously there's more to it and I'd recommend reading a few books on Austrian economics if you're really interested."}

With the APY and APR people are getting off their crypto banks will have to adopt to stay relevant. I understand that yes, at the current price this was purchased for 70 dollars and that equals .02 ether. But if you have the 70 cash it would be a far better investment to use the American Shitcoin dollar and not a form of payment worth far more than what it was spent on.

Im in the southeast, mid to small college town. Pay twelve dollars and throw in a five for tip. But just an average cut, I wear a hat a lot. 😁Not because of the hair cut! So the price sounds about right if you take into account, location. Glad to see more user end of ETH. Thanks for the post."}
