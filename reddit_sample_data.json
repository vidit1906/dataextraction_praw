It works well enough for now, but the number of complaints about pending transactions here is getting really old. Everyone knows. Shut up and be patient. \n\nA lot of us here are happy to hold tight for the long term because we believe in the potential of this technology. Thank goodness we have the opportunity to buy before mainstream awareness. Happy to be here and I couldn\u2019t care less about the state of the tangle right now. ",

Not \"huge\" announcement...an announcement.  He has every right to do this and in fact NEO should have some level of promotion like literally any organization/company has.\n\n- 2) People took a casual announcement and went from 0 to 100mph in a second.  Some competed for who could make the most over the top prediction, completely detached from reality.  The pinnacle being that the Chinese govt would literally give NEO it's blessing (something that is never going to happen for any platform east or west and is completely out of the scope of what any government would ever do).\n\n- 3) traders took advantage of the naive community and had a field day.  Yesterday and today we have been hearing the cries of people from the other side of the trades who are in the red.\n\n- 4) these people with bad entries (for the time being) started complaining and attacking NEO members.  \n\nMalcolm is fully within his right to announce there will be some news in a few days/monday.  Its a percentage of this community who ran with it and some were burned (and likely not even that bad if you have more than a month or two of patience).  In the end the NEO community looked like a bunch of animals after this ordeal.  Your fomo and trades are YOUR responsibility. Don't put the blame on anyone but yourself.  I'll add that fred did nothing wrong either.  There's a language barrier and some misunderstood him.  He did his best dealing with thousands of obnoxious greedy crypto investors frantically yelling at him for something he didn't even announce.\n\n\nWith that said, I want to say thank you to the NEO team for so much accomplished these last few months and not all of us behave this way.\n",

The main point of the discussion was the consensus which has to be taken as a basic approach on the realisation of the tech. And we\u2019re happy to announce that we\u2019ve finally found a path which has successfully gone through the PoC. We\u2019re still considering untraceable tokens as a technology which is able to make a breakthrough among the crypto community.\n\n\nWell, to make this feature live, we need some resources. Firstly, we need about a year of active development to help make the technology run smoothly and be user-friendly, so anyone who\u2019s willing to launch his own ICO will be able to do it with ease. Secondly, we\u2019ll also need to involve more truly genius people to the project. Moreover, such a development needs a certain amount of finances to build it. In this case, we\u2019ll need to start our own ICO to raise the capital. The capital we\u2019ll raise will support the development of the technology that the crypto community really needs. \n\n\nWe\u2019re looking forward to getting your reply and opening this to further discussion.\n\n\nYours truly, \n\nJenny and the Dev Team",

The legitimacy that is coming through IOTA is beneficial for every project in the space.\n\nNow, it seems like they created a rule against these things. New members to foundations. \n\nThis rule is dumb as f*** and looks like it's tailored especially for IOTA since IOTA's most important news is that companies work with IOTA, they join the IOTA Foundation. It's building a great basis for what's about to come. \nThis is real-world adoption in the making. \n\nThe reason behind the rule of the /r/cc is, IMO, completely nuts, and was made to stop IOTA from finding investors and devs. \n\nIOTA has many enemies, due to the lack of mining, the zero fee model and last but not least: the scalability. \n\nIf anyone thinks these are just conspiracies, you may have forgotten that IOTA faces serious allegations that were based on lies, with the vulnerability report. \n\nDozens of enemies in social media, Bitcoin maximalists, \"alleged professors\" are still salty and use every occasion to spread misinformation against IOTA. \n\nThis is the reality. \n\nThe earliest adopters of Bitcoin back in the days started the subreddit /r/cryptocurrency, so naturally, they are mostly Bitcoin believers.\n\nBut between us, nano gets also general support from them.  \n\nI, personally, will boycott this subreddit. \n\nI won't participate, I won't retweet, I won't vote or interact in any possible way. \nAs long as they didn't sort out their stupid anti-IOTA rules that harm adoption for IOTA, and in the end the reputation of the whole space as it makes it look like a centralized tyranny. \n\n10 people decide what 650.000 people can read. Let that sink in. \n\nThat doesn't sound like a barrier-free solution we try to achieve with all of this. It sounds like a centralized shitshow of a private venture capital club. \n\nAgain, I'm here as Limo, not as a moderator of some kind. ",

And before I go big on Qtum I would like to understand more how future problems will be handled.\n\n1. **How exactly do you calculate the voting weight?** In the white paper you wrote \"amount of qtums \\+ coin age\". But what if I have qtums of different ages in my wallet? You got any function for that or something?\n2. **Who elects the final 9 members of the Judgement Committee?** I found the following contradiction: in another reddit post you wrote that the community \\(thus all qtum holders\\) elect the 9 members but in the White Paper you state that the community elects 50 representatives and that out of these 9 are elected.\n3. **Who pays the Judgement Committee?** Is their salary calculated into the budget?\n4. **Do you make your financial reports public?** I assume that the community has no say over the allication of recources as with Dash, but do you at least make the financial reports public at the end of each quarter? Or does the Judgement Committee publish the KPI assessment?\n5. **When is the voting starting?** Currently in the client I find no option for voting. Somewhere in a roadmap I found that you plan to implement it June 2018. Is that correct?\n6. **Does DGP mean that it is on\\-chain voting?** So within the client there will be a voting options connected to the pre\\-set parameters and once a voting round is finished, the result is automatically applied to the software? **How often do you plan to vote? In case the DGP is on\\-chain, you probably have also off\\-chain votings, e.g. in case of disputes?**\n7. **What do you plan to have as voting issues?** From what I understand until now, as \"on\\-chain\" blocksize and gas price\\- what else? And as \"off\\-chain\"?\n8. **On what platform are \"off\\-chain\" votes going to be coordinated?** On your Qtum Forum? It looks pretty dead currently.\n9. **Who exactly do you consider as a governing party?** Any node? You stated in an article that at the beginning you are going to select trusted governing parties? How do you decide at the beginning whom to trust?\n10. **Do you plan do implement a delegated mechanism as in Ark, Waves, Lisk?**\n\nThank you very much! Looking forward to a lively discussion :\\)\n\nCheers!",

        "post_title": "Thank you NEO, today i payed off my student loan i started as an 18 year old.",
        "post_body": "Today I finally paid of my student loan I started almost 10 years ago, thinking about it still makes my blood boil. \n\nSome facts about the loan: When I was 18 years I was in college, my bank contacted met to offer me a loan so I could cover my expenses (like they knew what kind of expenses I had). The loan was for a maximum of 5.000 EUR, and I would have to start paying back after I finished college. To offer this to an 18 year old is in my opinion seriously irresponsible and unethical. For the people that don\u2019t know this: the frontal lobe of the brain fully develops around the 25th year. This part contributes to planning, responsibility, forward thinking and maturity in general. As an 18 year old, all I could think of was 5.000 EUR, off course I knew I would have to pay it back. But how bad can it be? After college I would get a great job anyway right? I am not trying to make up excuses for my actions, I made it, regret it, but still take responsibility for it. As you can imagine for an 18 year old, I spend everything within 6 months or so on complete rubbish (with exception from my drivers license).\n\nSo here is the catch from the loan (which, at the time I couldn\u2019t, or wouldn\u2019t,  fully comprehend):\n\nThere is an 8% interest rate, you have to start paying back a minimum of 100 EUR a month 2 years after you graduate (or drop out) from college. So let me lay this out for you:\n\nYear 0: 5.000\nYear 1: 5.400\nYear 2: 5.832\nYear 3: 6.299\nYear 4: 6.802\nYear 5: 7.347\nYear 6: 7.934\nYear 7: 8.569\n\nUnfortunately I had 1 extra year of college, and some trouble finding a job (financial crisis and all), so at the time I had to start paying back the loan my grand total was 8.569 EUR with an ongoing interest of 8%. The interest that I had to pay the first year (8% of the grand total) was 686 EUR. With the minimum payout of 100 EUR a month this would mean in the first year of paying back I payed more interest than down-payments. If I would keep up at this rate, I would have payed the loan off after 11 years. 11 years of 1200 EUR a year = 13.200 EUR for an original loan of 5.000 EUR. \n\nFortunately I stumbled upon Bitcoin and Crypto\u2019s in early 2017, and decided to put a little money in bitcoin, and after some research in Antshares. I rode the NEO train and this week I payed out enough to be freed of this awful loan, the feeling when I payed of this loan was such a relief. I have  a good job at the moment, but not that good to pay 8.000 EUR in one year, I still have to pay my monthly expenses and all. \n\nSo what did I learn from this experience? The first thing is that I really have zero respect for letting young adults make these decisions that have an impact for the next 20 years. I view this as very unethical, I am for responsibility and all, but to make this kind of an offer to an 18 year old guy is morally questionable. Second, I have got minimum respect for bankers and their practicing.\nSo nothing good? Hell yes, this whole experience made me more financially responsible. I will never take out loans again (with exceptions of maybe a mortgage for a house), I am starting to save money and try to be very financial aware. I\u2019m hoping to start accumulating diverse assets in the coming years so that one day I can be truly financially free. The last good thing is I am really into the crypto market, for the profits off course, but maybe even more for the idealistic part. I think cryptocurrency in general is the perfect way to be financially aware, you are seriously thinking about investing, saving, and being financially active. The decisions you make can have a very large impact on your live, this can be applicable to the \u201cfiat world\u201d as well. I still have some crypto assets left, and hoping this can be the start for something beautiful. I just want to say thanks to this amazing technology and the very helpful community of Reddit in general, and a toast to a good future for all of us.\n\nTLDR: Got screwed by a bank in taking a loan, crypto helped me pay it of, thank you crypto\u2019 s and thank you community of Reddit. \n",

        "post_body": "I've seen this over and over and over, \"Banks don't need to use XRP to use the Ripple ledger\".  TRUE!  But, here's why some are ALREADY using, and WILL ALL use XRP eventually.\n\nRipple's approach to adoption is two-fold:\n\n1) Get the banks to use their ledger software to send fiat money (without necessarily requiring XRP), instead of the SWIFT way.  This step is important because it doesn't radically change the way banks do things today, but it does give them some very valuable tools and real-time information about their money transfers.  This is what most Ripple-partnered banks are talking about when they say they are using Ripple's products.  What also comes with this software is a Ripple feature called xRapid, which leads us to step..\n\n2) Once banks are Ripple-integrated, they will have the 'option' of using XRP (via Ripple's xRapid feature), but they don't have to; but they will want to eventually; let me explain:\n\nThe first adoption step puts the option to use XRP right in front of the banks' noses.  And while at this time it may seem irrelevant to their existing infrastructure, it will be profoundly easy to start using XRP if they get curious.  Why would they want to use XRP then?\n\n- it would take very little effort to start using the integrated xRapid feature\n- they would save an additional 30% on transfer fees\n- their competitors are using it, undercutting them and taking business away\n- and most importantly: ELIMINATES NOSTRO ACCOUNTS!!!!!\n\nLet me say that again because it's super important\n\nUSING XRP ELIMINATES THE NEED FOR NOSTRO ACCOUNTS!!!...\n\n(To continue reading, I've moved this article to http://galgitron.net/Post/Heres-how-and-why-XRP-will-be-used-by-banks)",

        "post_body": "&#x200B;\n\n[Tipping Dash builds camaraderie, and attracts newcomers to the world of digital cash.](https://preview.redd.it/m7k5k8p15go11.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7c42037fd3b10fa1f52c85bc054de0b514b0dd99)\n\n**Hi Dash Nation,**\n\nI have been helping /u/DeltaEngine to refine the tipbot for Reddit. I'm happy to say that after running some tests with the bot here and in other subreddits, the tipbot is ready for some serious use. And serious use is what I'm proposing.\n\nWe have an opportunity here to create a hotbed of cryptocurrency activity. The impression that we make on anyone who visits us is important. Being respectful and engaging in factual discourse is great, but there is a way to kick up the ambiance a notch. As anyone who visited r/dogecoin can attest, the fun you can have while tipping even small amounts is contagious.In addition, the added benefit is making this sub busier, more conversation, becoming sort of a mini-Steemit, where people's contributions are met with an introduction to the world of Dash through the tipbot. This is a great thing when you're goal is to spread adoption. We've got to get Dash into as many people's wallets as possible, and we can have a blast while doing it.\n\n**So, my challenge to you, Dash Nation, is grab an account with the tipbot, and start rewarding top quality comments when you see 'em, not just here, but when you see 'em on other subs as well.**\n\nThe more people that do this, the better. Let's make r/dogecoin look like amateurs! (No offense, r/dogecoin, lol)\n\n**Guide to get started with the challenge:**\n\n* Get a Reddit /u/MyDashWallet account by clicking on it's username, send it a private message with \"deposit\" on the subject line, and \u201cdeposit\u201d in the body of the post.\n* Send it to the bot.\n* You will get a response with an address for depositing Dash. Also, you will get a link to maintain your account on [mydashwallet.org](https://mydashwallet.org).\n* Send Dash to the address that the bot gives you. You are now ready to tip.\n\n**Guide how to tip:**\n\n* Identify a user/post that you think deserves a big fat tip, or a new user that is curious about Dash.\n* Reply to the post with **\"**/u/MyDashWallet **tip \\[AMOUNT\\]\"** Ex. /u/MyDashWallet tip 1 mDash\n* Note: After this initial mandatory message (*must be in that order*) you can write anything else you want to say to the poster you're replying to such as \"/u/MyDashWallet tip 1 mDash for that fantastic writeup\" or \"/u/MyDashWallet tip 1 mDash to get you started in your digital cash journey\"\n* The bot will respond in a few seconds and send the tip!\n* Added benefit: Users that you tip will automatically have their own Dash accounts set up!\n* Enjoy the feeling of spreading cheer.\n\nThat's a quick primer, but for those who would like to get more in-depth with it, please visit [https://mydashwallet.org/](https://mydashwallet.org/) for more information, or contact /u/DeltaEngine.\n\n**We can make this sub something else if we all get behind this, Dash Nation. What say you?**\n\nOnwards and upwards,\n\nTao Of Satoshi\n\nDash Nation Founder and Dash Forums Moderator",

        "post_body": "Buy some fucking property you douchenozzles. \n\nThe type of money people will be making in the next few years due to this crypto market is insane. Normal everyday people that never thought they would be able to rise above paycheck to paycheck living are going to have an immense amount of opportunity. \n\nI felt compelled to write this post cause it's 4AM here and I can't sleep after this crazy day with Tron. I'm a RE/MAX agent in Florida so for my entire career my focus has been on how real estate can be the best investment. Luckily I stumbled into the crypto world and my life has been flipped upside down. I just made some tea and set up my hookah to write down some thoughts.\n\nHere's a question you need to ask yourself - Do you want to set yourself up for long term success by leveraging your earnings from crypto, OR do you want to be a dumbass and buy a Lamborghini that still won't help you get laid?\n\nMaybe that was harsh but I want to catch your attention because these memes about Lambos that are regurgitated over and over in the crypto world make me think that the typical crypto investor is like a 23 year old dude who would totally go buy a fancy ass car the second he could afford one. Let me drop some knowledge from my area of expertise so hopefully I can help atleast one person set themselves up for success in the future.\n\nHere's some things to think about.\n\nIf you want to succeed long term remember this - Not all real estate purchases are a good investment. \n\nTo set yourself up for life you need to buy an income property. Duplex, Triplex, Quadplex, apartment buildings, there are lots of possibilities. If you have enough money to buy any of these cash or even a sizeable amount for a downpayment you are off to a good start to becoming financially secure for the rest of your life. People will always need a place to live and if you're the provider, you will always be collecting the money instead of spending it. \n\nIf you do this correctly you can also find a property that has potential to appreciate. Let's say you buy a 500k quadplex, are constantly collecting rent, a few years down the road it might be worth 700k. Totally depends on the market, but where I live it happens all the time. I know these sound like noob gains compared to what we see on a daily basis in the crypto market but the reality is it's concrete, you will always have it and it will always provide value and continue to provide value.\n\nTo illustrate this - If you buy a 500k income property and are getting returns of 40k-60k every year after expenses, that's basically a full time job for doing nothing but collecting rent. Do this a few times over the next 5-10 years and pretty soon you're collecting 200k a year on permanent vacation by the time you're 40. \n\nThe good thing about income properties is it's typically one building with multiple units. That means you just have to replace 1 roof, 1 electrical system, a few AC units etc instead of having to manage a ton of single family homes. \n\nEven if you're not on that level, atleast aim to buy a duplex. You can live in one side and rent the other. Once you have a property paid off a bank will be much more willing to lend you money to buy more properties because you have a ton of collateral in an appreciating asset. If you live on the premises you can also get some pretty sweet tax deductions.\n\nHere's another idea - Buy a property you can use to make money with AirBnB. If you live in a place where people like to visit you can make a shitload of money and have fun doing it. I was looking at a property tonight where I live - Listed at 550k, completely renovated triplex literally 30 second walk to one of the best beaches in the US. They currently make between 60k-80k just renting that out on AirBnb. The cool thing about it is you can also live on premises and meet people who are traveling while they pay you lots of money. I would get a hot tub installed and make it attractive for hot young ladies to come visit, but that's just me trying to live my best life. Note - AirBnB gets shut down in some cities though so make sure to check out local regulations.\n\nHere's what you shouldn't do. Buy a big ass house with shit you don't need. You'll get stuck with a huge tax bill and I would be willing to bet that you'd get sick of maintaining it. Financial freedom is what brings happiness, not a bunch of space to fill up with shit you don't need.\n\nAnyways I just wanted to share this thought to potentially save someone from making a dumb ass mistake. I know what dumb ass mistakes feel like considering I just tried to make gains with my TRX and ended up losing 40k coins tonight, doesn't feel too great but I was lucky enough to get in somewhat early so I'm not sweating it too bad. \n\nConsider the long term both in this TRON investment and what will come after. Most people don't have these opportunities until they're in their 40's or 50's after a life time of work and savings. Luckily some of you might have a pretty sweet jump start. \n\nAlright that's all I got. Good luck and try not to be a dumbass. \n\n",

However in my opinion I think we are going to see closer to a grand or two grand per coin. Maybe with time we will see bitcoin private reach the five or ten grand level. However I am not certain when that will be. \n\nIt seems that this market is basically a popularity contest with support often going to those coins that are shilled by the right people. To think that coins like ethereum and bitcoin where just a fraction of their price years ago is crazy. There seems to be a certain hype around this coin that other forks do not have. I wonder why this is. \n\nThis is a very high price but someone who has been in crypto for while said it is not unrealistic to think that bitcoin private could get to the tens of thousand of dollars level sometime in 2018 depending on what transpires with bitcoin. \n\nHopefully we all do well. \n\n",

        "post_body": "The question \"Why will the price of XRP increase?\" gets asked repeatedly, so I thought I'd express my opinion and understanding of how the price will increase and *needs* to increase for XRP to be successful. \n\nA common misunderstanding I see is that people are really caught up on market capital and use that calculation to determine how many XRP need to be purchased by banks and institutions to fulfill transactions. This leads to incorrect assumptions where someone says something like \"If I want to send $1 billion dollars to another bank, then I need 1 billion XRP\" (assuming XRP are worth $1 each). That is not how it works. 1 billion XRP is currently 2.6% of the entire circulating supply of XRP, if someone were to sell or buy 1 billion XRP right now, it would wreak havoc on the market and they could potentially not end up with anywhere close to $1 billion after selling 1 billion XRP.\n\nLet's look at some smaller numbers on Poloniex's USDT/XRP pair to clarify this statement. As I write this, XRP is trading at 0.9 USDT (let's just assume that USD/USDT are currently 1:1 for this example as well, and all price figures I give are correct at the time of writing). If I want to send Dave's bank $1,000,000 right now, I will need to buy $1 million dollars *worth* of XRP. I can't just buy 1 million dollars at the lowest price, because on the order book that price of 0.9 is only for 6.12 XRP. The next sell order at 0.9014 dollars is 306.54 XRP. And that price keeps going up as you fill each sell order, because that's how order books work.\n\nIn order to buy $1 million worth of XRP, I need to scroll a long way down the sell orders until the sum of all the sell orders is $1 million. And conveniently enough, the point the sell order summed total exceeds $1 million is at the sell price of 1.000 USDT. \n\nWhen I put in my $1 million dollar purchase, I do not end up with 1,111,111 XRP (1,000,000 / 0.9). I'll end up with somewhere in the region of 1.07 million XRP. As you fill each sell order, it pushes the price up so your average buy in will be somewhere in the region of 0.93 based on Poloniex's current order book. \n\nBut what's now happened? I've consumed every sell order up to the 1.000 USDT mark. I'm now technically sat on 1.07 million XRP valued at $1 each according to the market capital calculation. My $1 million dollar purchase is now magically worth $1.07 million dollars? I just made $70,000 by doing nothing! Or did I? Of course I haven't, because the exact same process works in reverse for buy orders.\n\nSomething else to bear in mind with this scenario is that bots and traders will see the massive purchase and then start buying in themselves as they think that something important is happening. I.e. FOMO by traders/speculators, or automated responses from bots. \n\nWhen Dave's bank receives my 1.07 million XRP, he then has to sell them to get his dollars I promised him. So now the exact same process happens in reverse. As he sells his XRP, it drives down the buy price. Now hopefully he'll end up with $1 million at the end of it. But if bots/traders see 1 million XRP being dumped, then it could push the price down as people panic (in exactly the same way that buying 1 million dollars worth of XRP would cause FOMO). \n\nSo why does the price of XRP need to be high? It needs to be high to avoid this scenario occurring. I'm just going to use the following figures as examples, they're not in any way price predictions:\n\nImagine now that each XRP is worth $100 each. To send the same dollar value, I now need to buy significantly less XRP than I did previously. Let's pretend that ends up as 10,000 XRP exactly (I know it won't as per my previous examples). 10,000 XRP is only 0.00001% of the total XRP in existence. So this means that less sell orders get consumed and the price does not jump as much. \n\n[JoelKatz used a similar example for buying a house with Bitcoin]( https://twitter.com/joelkatz/status/963266416462897152) back when it was worth $10 each vs what it is today. If you read that whole twitter conversation, he basically explains this much better than I could anyway.\n\nNow XRapid already solves this problem somewhat as it *locks in* the sell and buy orders to avoid these spikes, but it still needs the liquidity. As far as my understanding goes, if Bank of Steve wants to send $1 billion to Bank of Dave today, then there's just not enough liquidity in the market for XRapid to find the XRP for that transaction. That is why the price needs to and will go up for XRP to succeed and to be used by banks. The price will go up as it gets used by more and more institutions all competing for the same resource (XRP).\n\nAnyway, that's how I understand things. Feel free to please point out any inaccuracies or debate my comments. At the end of the day, we're (mostly) all here because we believe XRP has a bright future. I've been holding since September 2016 and invested back then because of my assumptions above (albeit there was no xRapid back then, but the use case of cross border payments was still the same).\n\nEDIT: Typos and reformed introduction.\n\nEDIT2: Changing link around as the mobile app appears to be picking up the twitter URL and using David's face as the post image.",

When I first saw it, I thought it was so helpful, I shared it with several friends and relatives who were interested in investing. The content seems great on the surface but it conceals a nasty scam.\n\nThe poster is user/WillRog79 and he does a great job of luring in users, only to steal their IOTA.\n\nHow Does He Do This?\nEmbedded in the extensive help is a link to a seed generator. On the surface the link looks totally legit; the human-readable text points to the ipfs.io/ipfs/... but the hypertext address that you get sent to has a different domain lpfs.io - did you notice the difference?\n\nThe correct link starts with the letter I while the bogus one starts with the letter L. In lowercase text, they're almost impossible to tell apart unless you look really closely.\n\nOur friend WillRog78 is even smart enough that if you enter the root scammer domain, it redirects to the valid one. It's only if you enter the full link that you get served a scamming web page that is a complete replica of the authentic seed generator.\n\nWithin hours of making a deposit using one of these seeds, your funds will be withdrawn and stolen from under your nose. All by someone posing as a \"helpful\" person out to assist the community. This post has been upvoted nearly 3,000 times so I can only imagine that hundreds of folks have used the site and many of these have had their funds stolen.\n\nMy young friend just had 3Gi stolen from his wallet because I shared the link to this so-called \"help manual\" - money he could ill afford to lose and I'm guessing that many of the folks reporting lost funds may also have been victims of this scam. \n\nPLEASE HELP TRACK THIS CROOK DOWN AND LET'S STOP OTHERS FROM HAVING THEIR MONEY STOLEN TOO.\n\nIt's criminal activities like this that make new investors scared to work with Iota. If anyone knows of a way to track the funds, please let me know. I have the bundle and hash info for the confirmed withdrawal if it would help.\n\nDON'T GET SCAMMED. BE SAFE OUT THERE.\n\nEDIT: The phishing link has been taken down and the link corrected to the correct domain. I still advise people not to trust online seed generators and to use an offline method such as KeePass2. Even then, I suggest manually editing 5-10 characters of the generated seed just to guarantee that there is no way your seed could be compromised.\n\nEDIT: I have changed the post so the link is no longer clickable. I also informed both Dom and David about this scam and received a thank you email back. No word from anyone if there's a way to \"follow the money\" trail and freeze the funds or to reimburse those who can prove that they were victims. If anyone has ideas about how we could trace these bastards and bring them to justice, please let me know. I don't even know which law enforcement agency would even have jurisdiction in a case like this.\n\n",

The first idea we have had is to create a simple Bitcoin Cash animated advert to show people what Bitcoin Cash is. This will cost about $220 and will then cost an additional $100 per extra voiceover language we add to it. Any additional funds will be used for further marketing, as to be decided by the community.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWe have a funding address which is:\n\n**1EwVijWQAdu5H9Dszo49StS45ViB34P1dc**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n100% of funding is going to go towards marketing Bitcoin Cash. We have lots of ideas on what else this fund could be used for.

Two points a pattern does not make, that\u2019s why I\u2019ve presented three. What if I told you ETN is about to take the entire cryptospace by storm \u2013 catching everyone by surprise \u2013 and I could also tell you why: \n\n(Before I do, please bear in mind as the Proverb says: \u201cFaithful are the wounds of a friend; But the kisses of an enemy are profuse.\u201d  Put another way:  A good friend is not afraid to give a harsh truth.)\n\nMost of the Top 20 cryptos are vapor; ideas and concepts with zero tangible product and limited to no use for day-to-day application whatsoever. Have I offended one of your tribes or are you still with me? Remember the Proverb.  ETN are about to (I believe) take this entire cryptospace by storm with not just one -- but many -- real and actual products (Mobile Miner, Insta Payments, Vendor API, KYC/AML system under development, and several other real items I won\u2019t mention). Who else is doing this? (rhetorical). Point is, action is everything and ETN unlike other crypto projects actually executes and delivers on its vision with real tangible items already being used -- and this makes all the difference. \n\nIt's kind of like if all these other cryptos are promising really cool designs and concepts for a new automobile, and people are investing heavily in their ideas because it sounds so cool...but one minor problem: nobody is making the damn things. Their production lines remain empty but the promises and visions keep building. But still no automobiles are being produced. \n\nThen Electroneum comes along and rolls out a whole fleet of these incredible vehicles! Here's the mobile miner \u2014 hop in and take her for a spin it's ready to roll! Vendors, here you go, an instant payment solution that is FREE unlike the 1-3&#37; merchant charge Visa and Mastercard have, and stay tuned we are rolling out more. \n\nHere's the deal, there will be a tidal wave of interest, I believe it, because ETN has and continues to deliver on its promises with impressive and real products (not vapor) that are currently being used and are now ready for the global masses.

People are amazing ya know.\n\nThe gig ecomomy angle is interesting and another way to attempt to lay the foundation for ETN to become the f digital currency of choice in the areas they are penetrating first.\n\nIf the price can rise and there are places to spend ETN besides just the phone service providers, then who knows, it could gain a following of users and local vendors that accept it.\n\nLike I've said before, I believe that once there is demand to convert ETN into local fiat someone will provide that service. If it isn't already being adressed and put in place via the mobile phone providers existing system of vendors who sell top ups and such."

The matter that it feels so sudden, right before mainnet 2.0 hatched for the world, slow adoption had started with a big exchange, many use cases were theoretically hammered out and the leadership seemed excited, is totally uncoherent for a project that was perceived no lesser than one of the few real use case projects among the cryptosphere. What are 40 Bitcoin ATMs against thousands of Omise payment vendors? Why is the C-level (Jun, Vansa, etc.) so quiet on this? GBV\u2019s talk about the acquisition at Boxmining was definitly not a serious business approach for \u201ca new era of clients and integrations\u201d.

        "post_title": "Crucial information about our blockchain. dBFT explained. By beczka2006",
        "post_body": "Dear redditors, \n\nI would like to clarify some misconceptions about GAS, and how its function on the blockchain will affect and correlate with NEO valuation. The purpose of this post is to provide information, rather than speculate on price. However, I will add my personal opinion on how the valuation of both coins is strongly connected.\nFirstly, GAS is the equivalent of AntCoin, so it is the main \"currency\" on the NEO blockchain. By saying \"currency\", I mean it is more like fuel. The cost of registering new assets, issuing complex smart contracts, storage, and transaction fees will be covered in GAS. You probably knew about that, but the redistribution of GAS to NEO holders is vastly misunderstood. Before I add clarification, however, let us talk about how the GAS is mined in dBFP protocol, as it is not the same as PoS.\n\nYou already know that GAS is being mined automatically via set algorithm, and then redistributed for the next 22 years equally to all NEO holders. At the same time, most investors does not have a clue about nodekeepers, voting system and fee redistribution. I believe these concepts are crucial to understand fully the potential of both- NEO and GAS.\n\nNodekeepers are the validators of the blockchain transactions. I believe in the old Antshares times they were called bookkeepers, but they are the same, it is just a term describing one and the same thing. NK are elected in public voting by NEO holders. Chosen NK then set the fee on every transaction on the blockchain. The GAS used for fees on transferring coins is redistributed to NK, not all NEO holders. However, here comes the trick that I believe puts NEO at the Iron Throne of the CryptoLand.\n\nThe high transaction fees for using the blockchain will not be beneficial for the ecosystem itself. The higher the entry and maintenance cost, the fewer companies would want to register their assets on it. So the nodekeepers are forced to always, I repeat always, keep the transaction fees at minimal, or even 0 level. If they set too high prices, they will be \"fired\" by NEO holders in voting, as it would have detrimental effect on the blockchain development. Therefore, being a nodekeeper on NEO is of no use for ordinary person. It does not have any economic incentive. \"Why the ^%ll would then anyone want to validate transactions for free??\" -one may ask. Well, I will answer this question in a second. Let me first clarify one more thing.\nWe now understand that the fees from transactions are distributed only to nodekeepers, not all NEO holders. We also understand that NK will keep them at non-existent level due to the sake of blockchain development and the fear of being controlled by NEO holders. So, where do our GAS dividends come from?\n\nNEO holder receive GAS that is spent by companies and dApps on smart contracts registration and validation. Paraphrasing, our dividends come from digital assets registration. The more companies will be using the blockchain, the more GAS will be redistributed to all NEO holders per year. Why is this system so innovative and ingenious?\n\nNEO holders will do everything to keep the blockchain attractive for new companies and assets as it will increase their dividends. Because of that they will only vote on nodekeepers that set the fees on the blockchain as low as possible, so it will attract new investors. Self regulated, cheap, and secure blockchain without miners (PoW), giving all a passive income?\n\nWait, there is the previously mentioned question: \"Why would anyone, for pete's sake, want to be a nodekeeper for free?\". Well, if you hadn't guessed already: the nodekeepers will only be people who already posses a huge amount of NEO. Because of passive income, they will be interested only in the blockchain development, and ecosystem safety and security. They will be losing some money on being a nodekeeper (0 or minimal fees redistributed to them), but when you hold dozens of millions in NEO you only care about the blockchain development so you can earn higher dividends from GAS from assets, smart contracts and registration fees.\n\nCan you see now how innovative and different economics NEO presents in comparison to other blockchains? You will never see the miners pressure as in BTC, high transaction fees or financially incentivised nodekeepers. Everyone of us play for the same team.\n\nNow, this is true as long as GAS will keep value of course. Nodekeepers will be earning money through their NEO possession, similar to all smaller investors on the blockchain. They will be doing their work as long as GAS keeps its value and the dividends are financially profitable. That is why right now all the nodes are kept by NEO Council and the first voting will happen only in Q12018. GAS and NEO price will depend on each other and always be connected. Actually the valuation of GAS will be the start level of valuation of NEO in future.\n\nAt the moment both coins possess only speculative value, as the blockchain has just started and the first companies and dApps are yet to come. I do not want to speculate about the ratio as it will establish itself in the following years, but I will say two conclusions that I, as a investor, draw from the above-mentioned facts. 1. The GAS is for now, only when it is actually used and blockchain develops can we talk about true valuation of NEO. NEO is for the future. 2. Looking at the recent speculative value I have a feeling that most people just buy NEO as \"Ethereum of CHina\", or \"Wealth generation|, without fully understanding dBFT system. So either the price of NEO is heavily overvalued now, or the value of GAS is heavily undervalued in todays market caps (1.7bln$ to 250mln$). I believe the latter is more probable though.\n\nDraw your own conclusions. It is not financial advice.\nBest regards. Beczka2006",

I've made thousands of trades I've made a lot of bad trades but also have made a lot of good trades, not just on NEO but on every coin. NEO is by far my favorite to trade. I've even traded NEO when it was ANT shares and still at $5.00. You start to learn a lot about the community that backs these coins just by trading it. Some communities don't care about the coin and just let it fall and fall, which make it unpredictable and a huge risk.  NEO is a coin with a strong community with a real purpose who won't let the coin free fall to the bottom without a fight. Yes NEO took a fall in the crash but what coin didn't. \n\nNEO is yet surprising me again, as a day trader I'm constantly looking for a coin to break off of bitcoins swings and take it own path especially in this bear market.. NEO is almost there and will be one of the first coins to start its own journey again not just micking bitcoin charts. As bitcoin takes its dips NEO is taking a smaller dip each time. Be happy if your HODLing NEO even if you bought at ATH as NEO should be valued much higher then it is right now.  If this crash never would of happened I promise NEO would of been at $300-$400 if not higher right now. \n\n\nCatch you all on the dip!\n",

        "post_body": "Why are things so slow after the tech update/fork?\nAfter the fork, blocks were being mined very slowly\n\nThe team initially thought that the high difficulty was the big culprit for this, coupled with the low hash rate. They reasoned that we were trying to mine blocks at a high difficulty with low hashing power (since all the ASIC miners are now gone) and that it should take time before the difficulty starts adjusting. Read more about how difficulty works here.\n\nBut that was only part of the problem...\n\nThe real problem (identified here) was related to a feature that was being removed in the new update, ring signatures, and the implementation thereof. Ring signatures were used in the past to obfuscate who the real sender of a transaction was. You could \"mix\" other transactions with yours and so hide the real sender of the transactions in there. The amount of transaction you \"mixed\" with yours was known as the ring size.\n\nThis feature was removed in the tech update, and no more mixing was allowed. Transactions could only have a ring size of 1. However, there were some transactions in the transaction pool from before the fork that have ring sizes of 5. And processing these transactions after the update is what caused problems.\n\nUnfortunately, it seems like only the \"checking\" part of the new software was coded right, and not the \"block creation\" part. They were assuming that no transaction in the pool would have a ring size of more than 1, and so it would not be necessary to check for that when putting together a block.\n\nSo as a result, blocks were being created with the unallowed transactions in them, but then immediately rejected by the checking part of the same piece of software, and by other miners who were running the new software.\n\nSo pools were mining blocks correctly, but they were rejected right away because of the faulty transactions in them.\n\nThe solution to this was just to empty (or flash) the transaction pool, and basically delete all transactions currently awaiting processing. This would keep all the ETN in the wallets of the original senders, and they would need to attempt the transaction again. These transactions would have been reversed anyway had we gone on like this since they would have expired after 3 days in the transaction pool\n\nThe team has asked several pools to empty their mempools.\n\nOnce all the mempools are flushed, and legitimate blocks are being created, it will still take some time to get through the first 75 blocks until the difficulty starts adjusting downwards, but not nearly as much time as it took initially.  \n\nhttps://electroneum101.com/status-of-the-tech-update-fork/",

It discredits it, makes it look like your typical 'hypecoin'. To clarify, I am an ETN holder, my concern is this will get a load of 'hype' before it is ready for it, and then get forgotten as it people don't take it seriously. That's what I think is crap and misleading. \n\nRegarding the app:\n\n1 - it simulates mining yes. Yet it implies that you are 'mobile mining' and the funds being given out are allocated for that purpose. Why don't people just use a faucet, that feels more 'honest' as at least you know it's based on advertising.\n\n2 and 3 - I can't argue with that, but it's not the first crypto to have an app, it's not 'revolutionary'. \n\n4 - Again, I agree, but that is also what faucets do.\n\n\nI hope that it does make it more accessible, but if people actually understood it they would be disappointed. \n\nI did not mean he was doing the pump and dump with malicious intent, just that it makes the token a prime price manipulation target. \n\nThis all comes down to the point I tried to make which was never a personal attack on you or ETN... imagine you are a novice crypto investor. If you were a sensible, would you invest in a token which does not actually do what it advertised, has an unfinished product, and has seen multiple price spikes in orders of magnitude.

It will only make us stronger and hold BPs to account better. Even trolls and repeated unjustified attacks on Eos are important to respond to by completely engaging with their comments fairly and openly. If you want to minimise damage by superfluous claims, then make sure you provide a solid defence that can be upvoted - otherwise underinformed, new members or press can continue to innocnetly and earnestly promote these ideas. The more critical of Eos we can be the stronger it will get. Turn the sword first on yourself. Don't be afraid to point out corruption or errors for the damage they can cause. Be clever considerate people and we can grow this long term. \n\n",

We may not have 100 ICO under our belt, but we are selective on our process and ultimately believe most ICO are and should be regulated as securities. \n\nWe have put together a great team of engineers, partnered law firms and marketing staff that is leading the charge for properly regulated token sales that use SAFTS. We also do engineering in house and never outsource our work.\n\nThough our engineers code in Solidity and have been using Ethereum for our clients, we will be shifting by use-case our clients to the NEO blockchain and have been in open-communications with the NEO team and developers for support and we are excited to support NEO; as in many instances it provides more benefits than Ethereum.\n\nSome of our clients have been:\nwww.locipro.com\nwww.knowledge.io\n\nI am advisor on Universal Health Coin: www.universalhealthcoin.com\n\nInterview on ICO and spoke about NEO with Investor Town Hall Show: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42JICL6EKdY&t=342s\n\nLooking forward to meeting you all on the 20th! \n\nNOTE:\n\n1) Please do not reply to other user's questions. 2) Try to be precise with your questions! 3) Please only ask a maximum of 2 questions per post.\n\nHosts of AMA will include:\n\nStephen Hyduchak (Founder and CEO) \n\nAmit Singh (Attorney, Stradling Law) http://www.sycr.com/Amit-Singh/\n\nJustin Fiocca (Creative Designer)\n\n\n",

The REAL prize is the BTCP! ...One who holds their BTCP through the midterm to the holiday spike may just look back on this day and have a real good laugh. I believe BTCP is going to be a good project that will pick up some traction this year and be worth a whole hell of a lot more come December. IT also may not be a bad idea to just hold your ZCL for another future fork. Especially if you are sitting with a loss right now because If BTCP is a success this year, others will definitely follow suit. ....So, if you are interested in getting some BTCP, now is a good time to get some on the cheap. Get 'em while they're hot cause there is only 24 hours left to get them into that wallet!",

It seems to me that a lot of the BP candidates see this as a money making venture rather than a way to promote decentralisation, as users we need to vote for those candidates who are really working for us.

        "post_body": "Segwit right now on BTC *is* a 51% attack. It is a 51% attack that the majority have accepted, thus it is termed \"a soft fork\" but on the pure technical level they are exactly the same thing, except they'd term it an attack if it was a soft-fork without social consensus. Anything over 51% has technical consensus, the real consensus that matters in Bitcoin. All node software would follow this chain as it would not be breaking the hard rules.\n\nA miner with 51% of hashpower trying to for instance pay himself 100,000BTC as a block reward would not be within consensus, he'd just be hard-forking, and would be a 100% miner - but on his own chain which would be worthless and of no concern. A hard-fork being accepted implies a loosening of the rules (all nodes would need to change their software to allow 100,000BTC block rewards for this attack to work).\n\nNow a soft fork is a tightening of the consensus rules, what once were \"Anyone Can Spend\" transactions which quite literally meant was money to be picked up by any miner and spent, are now soft-forked into being \"hey you can't spend these - they're Segwit\" and providing 51% of the miners are still going along with the soft-fork any attempt to spend them will not be allowed to be propagated and built on as a valid block. No node software needs to be changed to follow these rules, which is why old Bitcoin software before Segwit can still sync up to the latest block however due to the kludgey way Segwit works it sees them as \"Anyone Can Spend\" transactions and doesn't really understand them or the segmented signatures. So it's pretty useless to use and for a miner could only mine a empty block or a block with non-Segwit transactions, and if it tried to spend a segwit address other miners understanding segwit would reject its block.\n\nBut if a 51% majority starts to reject this soft-fork, then all Segwit addresses can be emptied out with the money going to the miner and there is nothing that the 49% of miners or the 100% of soyboys running non-mining Raspberry Pi nodes can do about it other than shitstorm on Twitter, FUD themselves to death and (try to) dump their BTC.\n\nMake no mistakes - it will totally collapse the coin and its value will rapidly become 0 as nobody will be able to move it. Exchanges will be the first to freeze, and a crypto without any exchanges and with most wallets being emptied by miners will trash the HODLings in non-Segwit addresses too. Miners will start mining on BSV and/or BAB and with the hashpower (security) dropping dramatically and approaching \"mom's basement\" levels of hashpower BTC will never ever be able to recover. Then fun things such as massive re-orgs and continuous empty blocks with political messages inside them will take place just for LOLz.\n\nAll the cryptoworlds anger will be pointed at Craig (I think like Honeybadger he won't give a shit as he's used to this) but legally not only is he only following protocol, he'll also be following the protocol that he copyrighted and everybody else will be the rogue actors, the ones culpable for this massive loss, as Craig takes down the 51% attack (Segwit) that they've been running a few years now.\n\nCraig has been nice and put out numerous warnings - now it's time to just wait as he reclaims his protocol.",

A technical change like a fork and a decision between bigger and smaller blocks doesn't seem like something that would necessarily infused with such mutual hatred.... but here we are.\n\nTo try and understand this a bit more - including the politics behind the divide - does anyone have any articles they've come across that they have found explains the issue well? Even if it is one-sided, if it defends its position we'll, I'd still be interested in reading it, while keeping in mind the bias of the writer.\n\nI'm just trying to understand the situation more, so any link to articles you have found helpful would be much appreciated!!\n\nEdit 1: Holy crap!  This blew up! I'm in Korea (cryptocurrencies are big here!!) at the moment, and woke up to a veritable gold mine of information here, so I'm just getting to work through all the comments that were added since last night now!  So trust me; I'm making my way through all of this!  \n\nI also want to say - for such a contentious topic (where it is clear there is a lot of history and where many of you have thrown in with one lot or the other) - thank you for keeping things civil here, as well as doing your best to help a person new to all this inform himself.  Sometimes, from the outside looking in, the 'big-blocker vs. small-blocker' dispute seems a bit like the United Atheist Alliance going to war against the Allied Athiest Alliance, so I greatly appreciated the opportunity you have all given me to inform myself and come to my own evaluation of what is going on. So again, thank you.   I didn't expect a response quite this awesome, and I think the fact that there is so much here is a testament to how good this community really is. At this point, the thread has taken on a life of its own, and I feel that as bitcoin and cryptomarkets grow, this thread is going to help quite a few of us curious souls new to all this wandering in from the cold.  \n\nSo again, to everyone who took the time to contribute here, thank you, and may Satoshi him(her?)-self smile upon your good fortune.\n\nEdit 2: I would also just like to say two more quick things.  First, I hope you don't mind if I ask questions below to some of you in places where I am a bit unclear about things.  And second, I'm just going to preemptively reiterate: I am new to all this, and am not on any one 'side'; in my questions I may make statements as I attempt to clarify things for myself, and those statements may either be supporting or attacking your 'side', but that is only because I'm trying to understand, and not because I am actually on one 'side' or the other.",

Bank's don't want to come out looking irresponsible.\n\nAnd Ripple obviously know this. Which is why they are focusing on Payment Providers for now like Moneygram, western union, Mercury FX etc. If you can catch the low hanging fruits and show cost savings.\n\nIt becomes easier for banks to see value and evaluate risks and push for positive regulation.\n\nAnd every central bank is looking at regulating Cryptos. So sooner or later there will be regulations. And when that happen's XRP will be available for use. Ready and tested.\n\nTo declare banks 'Don't want the currency' at this point of time and therefore XRP is worthless is irresponsible journalism and clumsy analysis.\n\nWhat Ripple has is potential that few or none of the other coins currently exhibit.

Well, here it is. For the rest of you who don't know what this is I'll fill you in... Some time back in late November after a night of drinking with some friends I came home and decided to check out /r/bitcoinmarkets to talk about Bitcoins. As you can see [in this thread ](http://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1rmc4m/can_you_guys_stop_bashing_the_bears/)I was so sure of my drunken predictions that I offered to eat a hat on video with ketchup if I was wrong. Well, I was wrong. Bitcoins and alcohol don't go well together. Lesson learned. I decided that I would actually go through with eating the hat but when it came down to it I always had something else I either needed or wanted to do in my free time instead. [In this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1v959g/daily_discussion_wednesday_january_15_2014/ceq1uog) you can see I got called out for not posting the video so I reached out to /u/seansoutpost to hold some of my bitcoins ransom for me until I actually did it.

The Decentralized Autonomous Organization \\(DAO\\) facilitates rapid courses of action and development consistently on a monthly basis. One example was the block size proposal submitted back in January 2016 to eventually increase the block size from 1MB to 2MB. The Masternode network reached an irrefutable consensus \\(2129 yes votes / 18 no votes\\) and the decision was made within a period of 24 hours to raise the block size. Compare that to Bitcoin where the debate literally took years and forced the community to initiate a hard fork. Without any further upgrades Dash is presently capable of supporting network traffic eight times that of Bitcoin\u2019s usage before running into problems, and Dash also has a long\\-term scaling plan to grow the network capacity far larger to include blocks of 400mb in size and beyond.\n\nI welcome you to the Dash community :\\)\n\nPlease join us on Discord.

[Enroll in Test Flight](https://www.Neodius.io)\n\n# About Neodius\nDue to the lack of mobile insights on your NEO and GAS assets; I've decided to create my own. Called **Neodius**.\n\nNeodius was built with the idea to have a better insight into your Neo Crypto Assets (love those hypie words :). Since NEO has that awesome GAS (neotogas.com click on about), it's good to see how much you have and how much you can claim. But most importantly, you want to know how many beers you can buy with your NEO \ud83c\udf7a. So i have implemented an automatic conversion from NEO to a (realistic) fiat value and a lot more features.\n\nNow most of you may ask, why not build a fully function wallet system in the first place. Good question: Well that has to do with Apple guidelines: The guidelines do not allow for \"non-accepted cryptocurrency payments\". Which are performed by a \"Fully functional wallet\". So NEO isn't yet an allowed Currency, but i'm currently working on getting NEO to be accepted on the App Store. However, I'm still waiting on a message from the App Store review team.\n\n**[Press display images](https://github.com/ITSVision/Neodius/blob/master/Artwork/Press%20Displays/press-displays.md)**\n\nFeatures currently are:\n\n* Multi-wallet\n* View your amount of NEO\n* View your GAS\n* View your unclaimed gas\n* View NEO value in BTC/ETH\n* View NEO value in fiat currencies ([View currencies](https://github.com/ITSVision/Neodius/blob/master/Neodius/Supporting%20Files/SettingCache/fiatCurrencies.json))\n* Automatic refreshing of your wallet.

        "post_body": "**EDIT: If you are interested in this initiative and/or want to contribute technical skills yourself, please sign up on the Monero Matrix server and join the #monero-recruitment room** [**using these instructions**](https://forum.monero.space/d/79-how-to-join-the-monero-core-team-matrix-server-web)**. A list of Monero's open research questions is available** [**here**](https://github.com/monero-project/research-lab/issues/94)**. And** [**here is a great guide**](https://www.monero.observer/ultimate-guide-new-monero-contributors) **on how to begin contributing to the Monero Project.**\n\nLet me open this half-baked proposal by saying: I have been a silent observer of Monero for years, but I am very new to actually working on Monero, so I may be very off base. Just let me know.\n\nIn order to ensure that Monero users' privacy is well-protected, it is essential to recruit more people with technical skills and knowledge to work on Monero. Over the last two years, Monero's already-limited quantity of high-quality talent has dwindled. We can debate forever why this has occurred, but in any case relying on a tiny number of star researchers makes Monero unacceptably fragile. This must change.\n\n# Where to start?\n\nScholars at universities and within university orbits are great targets for active recruitment. Being something of a scholar myself, it is pretty clear to me that a substantial number of them would be willing and able to contribute to cutting-edge Monero development. It should be self-evident that they are capable of doing so, so I will focus my words on the willingness aspect.\n\nLet me first say that working on Monero will remain niche. Only a small proportion of any set of workers would probably be willing to work on Monero. In the case of scholars at universities, this shouldn't be a concern because a small proportion of millions of people is still a lot of people.\n\nFirst of all, it is not our comparative advantage to compete with other \"employment\" opportunities on the basis of salary. Governments who wish to attack Monero have virtually limitless budgets. We can't compete with that. We don't have to either. We should target people for whom salary is not the only motivator. We probably wouldn't want someone whose only motivation is money, anyway, since they would have no qualms about turning around and going to work for Monero's adversaries, clandestinely or openly.\n\nFrom my experience with scholars, money is usually not at the top of the list of the factors that decide their employment choices. It is more complicated than that; a complication we can take advantage of. A far as I have been able to tell, here are some of the key motivating factors, in no particular order (numbered so I can refer to them subsequently):\n\n1. Increasing fame/reputation\n2. The satisfaction of working on interesting problems that fully engage their mental capabilities\n3. Money\n4. Making a real positive impact on others' quality of life through scientific advancement\n5. Contributing to \"pure\" expansion of the body of human knowledge, separate from any real-world impact\n6. Employment stability\n7. Teaching their knowledge to others\n\nAs I mentioned, the Monero Project probably cannot compete on (3) money. Employment stability (6) is complicated and I will return to it shortly. What Monero can offer people interested in (1) fame/reputation is partly up to the scholar. If they want to remain pseudonymous, then, well, working on Monero would come with an \"interesting\" type of fame when you are known by an alias only. For those who wish to work under their real identity, working on Monero with its $5 billion total valuation does offer a certain degree of reputation boost, depending on certain factors. (2) and (5) shouldn't be difficult, since Monero is at the cutting edge. (7) is up to the scholar, but there is no shortage of educational needs within the Monero community, translating technical concepts into user-level information.\n\n# Motivation (4): Making a real positive impact on others' quality of life through scientific advancement.\n\nLet me paint the scene of our situation in 2021. There is rising authoritarianism nearly everywhere. If anyone believes that \"It can't happen here\", I would reply that frankly that is a naive view, in my opinion. I see this very clearly since as a scholar, I share an ability that most scholar possess: we can often see the writing on the wall before everyone else.\n\nScholars are canaries in the coal mine for authoritarianism. Almost literally, in fact: In many instances of mass political violence in the 20th century -- and even previous centuries -- the authoritarians killed the teachers first. Then they went after everyone else. But they killed the teachers first because institutions of learning and knowledge represent an independent center of power within society that authoritarians cannot easily control. Authoritarians therefore attempt to co-opt or eliminate these institutions early in their plan of domination of society. Present-day authoritarians have already begun this work in earnest in a huge number of countries; it just may not be apparent yet if you do not have your ear to the ground and your hand on the pulse.\n\nAlright, enough doom and gloom. What does this have to do with recruitment? We need to formulate our pitch to technical workers in a way that makes it clear that Monero and similar technologies are a potent weapon against authoritarianism. I do think that, framed correctly and pitched in the right forums, this framing could make a small but sizable minority of scholars come out of the woodwork to help fortify Monero.\n\n# A note on the employment stability issue\n\nFrom my understanding, the Monero Research Lab (MRL) has had difficulty with staffing in part due to the sense that long-term employment with Monero is inherently unpredictable. That is a weakness that needs to be addressed and is somewhat outside of the scope of the already-lengthy post. However, let me say this:\n\nEmployment in universities and university orbits for scholars is already quite precarious. It sucks, in fact. Researchers are living grant to grant, they cannot settle in one place and start a family since they may have to switch institutions as limited grant funds run out. The probability of success of grants has shrunk dramatically to the point that the low probability almost negates the benefit of trying to write a lengthy well-researched grant proposal at all. [See here for more detail on this issue](https://medium.com/the-spike/how-not-to-choose-which-science-is-worth-funding-c6b4605ce8f1). Often scholars are stuck in a semester-to-semester adjunct teaching cycle at low salaries, no stability, and little formal employment benefits. Compared to all this, somewhat uncertain payment in XMR does not look so bad. Furthermore, work on Monero does not necessarily require full-time work for years. Monero can benefit from a set of fresh eyes looking at its challenges part-time for periods of a few months.\n\nIn short, systematic underfunding of scientific research and teaching by governments worldwide has created an army of disaffected technical workers. The Monero Project should recruit that army! Governments have sown the wind. Let them reap the whirlwind.\n\n# Private firms and legally-compliant grant foundations\n\nAs far as I see see it, there is probably a role for private firms and legally-compliant grant foundations in all this, if for no other reason than allowing a diversity of employment conditions for potential recruits. In addition, having private firms in the Monero ecosystem can provide potential recruits a clearer career path and \"exit strategy\" if you will. However, it may be a good idea for the CCS crowdfunding mechanism to remain at the core of funding activity.\n\n# Sketch of recruitment plan\n\nNow that the call-to-arms is done, on to more practical matters. Proposal up for discussion and modification:\n\n1. We will likely need to raise some funds beforehand, through the CCS and.or other mechanisms. It might be risky to go call in recruits and not have the money ready already.\n2. We formulate a Request for Proposal (RFP) for \"research grants\" or similar vehicle. We need to get the tone and pitch correct, but this step shouldn't be too difficult. We are on the right side of history, after all.\n3. Register the RFP (or whatever it is) with every reasonable research grant database.\n4. Do slightly more targeted work by sending the RFP to the email announcement lists of specific disciplines' associations, universities, departments, graduate student and faculty organizations, etc. There are a million of them out there.\n5. I have some ideas about more targeted recruitment, but they are not ready to share yet.\n\n# Keeping open the option to work pseudonymously is important\n\nIn our recruitment efforts, we should allow first contact with potential recruits to be completely pseudonymous. People can always voluntarily de-anonymize themselves as it suits them, but re-anonymizing yourself is not really possible. Allowing pseudonymous researchers can benefit the researchers. It can benefit the Monero Project as well by ensuring that changes in government regulation would not necessarily affect development.\n\n# Disciplines to target\n\nThis is up for discussion, but as I see it Monero has maybe three broad categories of needs:\n\n1. **Continued work in cryptography.** For this we would likely target mathematicians and computer scientists.\n2. **Establish a robust capability in theoretical and applied statistics.** For theoretical statistics, we are mostly looking at statisticians proper. However, for applied statistics we have a broad range of disciplines to choose from, as statistical work has become increasingly important to all manner of scientific disciplines, both natural and social.\n3. **Limited work in economics and game theory.** Certain key facets of Monero need attention by economists and game theorists, such as the fee structure and game theoretic analysis of attack vectors. Often, game theorists are also economists.\n\nOK! That's it. This is long enough as it is. Naturally, I am probably missing some big things, so fill me in on them. I can certainly help execute an active recruitment plan, but I can't do it all.",

Maybe only if you bought on the one or two days it was at its lowest point after the lawsuit announcement of around 20 cents and even then it's generous math.

        "post_body": "I'm always up for a little detective investigation.\n\nSo upon viewing Electroneum's video a second time, I started wondering if the writings on the till slips meant anything. Turns out they do!\n\n**Firstly...**\n\nThe store at which both purchases in the video are made is called [Who'd A Thought It](http://www.whodathoughtit.com/) \\- a classy restaurant & boutique hotel about [10 miles](https://www.google.co.za/maps/dir/Electroneum+Ltd,+Lyndean+House,+30-34+Albion+Pl,+Maidstone+ME14+5DZ,+UK/Who'd+A+Thought+It,+Headcorn+Road,+Grafty+Green,+Maidstone,+UK/@51.2352864,0.5710026,12.82z/data=!4m13!4m12!1m5!1m1!1s0x47df323b9c789c27:0x44186f33aab87209!2m2!1d0.5307424!2d51.2748361!1m5!1m1!1s0x47d8a8d15a4f12e3:0x2953065d25cdb773!2m2!1d0.672772!2d51.202722) from the Electroneum offices in Maidstone, Kent, UK. The address, phone number, and logo on the [slip in the video](https://youtu.be/FOtJVfZ29Es?t=1m29s) match the details of the restaurant, as does the products that were purchased. So this will probably be one of the first businesses implementing the instant payment beta system on 1 July. Who would've thought?\n\nAnyone who lives near there or has dined at this restaurant? Would be awesome to know if they're currently accepting Electroneum as a payment method! Please check it out!\n\n**Secondly...**\n\nAt the [bottom](https://youtu.be/FOtJVfZ29Es?t=55s) of the slip printed by the little printer, it says \"Powered By [ticketmachineapp.com](https://ticketmachineapp.com)\". When you visit this website right now, it simply has a logo, URL, and a UK phone number on it. Doing a [WHOIS](https://www.whois.com/whois/ticketmachineapp.com) search on the URL showed that it was registered on 26 October 2017 (about a week after the early close of the Electroneum ICO) by a person/company in Kent, UK (same general location as Electroneum).\n\nCouldn't find anything else on Google regarding a ticket machine app.\n\nIs this a spin\\-off business created by Electroneum, a new startup they're working with, or just a URL they're using for testing?\n\n**Thirdly...**\n\nFrom the labeling on the little printer, one can see that it is manufactured by [Star Micronics](http://www.starmicronics.com/) who manufactures various printers. This specific printer is the [Star SM\\-T300i](http://www.starmicronics.com/pages/SM-T300i) which is a lightweight, durable, portable printer that works with Bluetooth (it appears to also support printing from iOS devices). You can [order one](https://www.amazon.com/Star-Micronics-SM-T300I-DB50-Portable-Bluetooth/dp/B00C100TO4) on Amazon for $373.90.\n\nA vendor that wants to implement the instant payment system will probably not be required to use this printer. It's probably just used to show that slips can be printed just as easily as with ordinary fiat transactions. But interesting, nonetheless.\n\n**Fourthly...**\n\nThe point of sale system used in the second purchase example is powered by [OSPOS](http://www.opensourceposguide.com/) 3.2.0 (Open Source Point of Sale), as you can see in the title bar on the phone's screen recording [here](https://youtu.be/FOtJVfZ29Es?t=1m19s) (the part of the URL visible just appears to print the [transaction information](https://www.reddit.com/r/Electroneum/comments/8qmcm3/etn_team_needs_to_offer_an_option_for_printing/e0l2y8m) encoded in the QR code). OSPOS is browser based and therefore very easy to implement. It seems that Electroneum have already created an integration to OSPOS that store owners will be able to use.\n\nThe vendor integration API will allow any such service to integrate instant payments, including e\\-commerce websites and platforms, and OSPOS is just one example of this. But again, interesting.\n\n\\-\\-\\-\n\nExciting times ahead! I for one really can't wait for this system to go live!\n\nAnything else you can deduce from the video?",

        "post_body": "Hi All,\n\nThe recent announcement of adding Zcash to Cake Wallet has brought out very passionate voices against this move and some supporting it.  Honestly, we are humbled by how much passion is there in the monero world for Cake Wallet.  It\u2019s great to know that people are as passionate about Cake as the Cake Wallet team is.\n\nSome history: As some of you remember, Cake was built in a vacuum in 2017 funded fully by the founder and launched in 2018.  But after the launch, we became fully involved in the community and even took guidance from the community to open source the app.  Throughout the years, we have listened to the community on various things like what exchanges to add, or even what coins to add, etc.  Also since launch, we have been involved in many facets of the Monero world including donating to the dev fund, CCSs, related projects, competing projects, conferences, shows/podcasts, and much more.\n\nWhen we added BTC and LTC most monero folks didn\u2019t have a problem as these coins don\u2019t proclaim themselves to be privacy coins.  That brings us to Zcash and we can see how some might have problem with us adding it.  We have always worked with the community and now also have heard you loud and clear.\n\nBased on feedback, the following is the plan for Cake Technologies:\n\n* Drop everything and prioritize the Monero only app.  BTW, we have ALWAYS wanted to do a Monero only app for the hardcore folks. Our goal is to have this out by the end of the year and it will be available on Android and iOS.  It will still feature the exchanges and ultimately the buying of Monero through credit/debit cards.\n* Cake Wallet the current app will remain as it is now but may consider additional coins (like Ethereum or a stable coin or wownero) in the future.  Nothing will happen until we finish Monero only app.\n* For zcash, we will build a new and separate app.\n\nAgain we thank you all for the constructive feedback.   The above is not going to satisfy everyone as no plan is perfect, but the above plan does put Monero first.  Thank you all for reading.\n\nThe Cake Wallet Team\n\n[https://cakewallet.com](https://cakewallet.com)",

If the charities particularly worked with the \u2018unbanked\u2019 or microfinance that would seem to be quite fitting for what we\u2019re all passionate about on here, I think the particular charity would be pretty stoked to get a generous donation somewhat out of the blue from a group of Crypto enthusiasts !\n\nBased on how big the sub is now we could be talking hundreds of thousands of dollars to a good cause\n\nPost your thoughts, feelings, reactions, clearly we don\u2019t know when this point will happen (investor confidential reckon end of 2018) but we can hopefully come back to this and get it going around the $6\\7 mark....... \n\n <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<\n\n <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< \n\n<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<  \n    \n    \n    \n\n**UPDATE - 3/1/18**    \n    \n\n\nWow guys and gals, this is all pretty impressive\n\nProud to say I\u2019m part of this XRP community ! Seriously, this is awesome \n\nBased on the upvotes over about 12 hours we\u2019re already looking at 1000 XRP at $10 dollars a pop, v cool\n\nFirstly, my apologies for the length of this, probably not neccesary but trying (probably a bit too hard) to be of assistance!  \n\nI guess there\u2019s a few ways we could do this, firstly, I would say, I don\u2019t think we have to put in motion just yet, I guess once we start creeping up to $6\\7 (by which time we\u2019ll be #1 , every major news outlet we\u2019ll have XRP articles coming out of their ears, and Brad will be a gazillionaire ! ) then I think we get this going.   As people have said, not only will this be a meaningful way to help out one or two good causes as a community, I think it will be a nice antidote to us all focussing on our own riches, and obviously good PR for this fantastic sub-red\n\nI think we should choose a max of 3 charities to donate to, perhaps depending on our numbers at that time.  I suggest we keep this post as our go to on this topic, i suggest we all get stuck in and comment with charities we would like considered for the 3 we select.  There\u2019s obviously a lot of needy causes out there.  However, so this chimes with our interests on this sub I suggest we do focus our suggestions on charities that work with the \u2018unbanked\u2019, microfinance, technology etc.  I guess that will also just help to narrow down what could end up being a v v v long list of charities otherwise.\n\nSo, when we\u2019re all at that $6\\7 dollar mark, we\u2019ve all commented with our charity suggestions, I suggest 1) someone does a sift through the suggestions to make sure there\u2019s no anomalies, organisations that are not charities or charities v much unrelated what we\u2019re wanting to focus on this time round 2) suggest then all the suggestions go in a hat, we pull out 10(?) and these become our 10 to vote on. (before the vote happens I suggest we check each charity is registered with the relevant authority as a proper charity, e.g. here in U.K. we have something called the charity commission and every legal charity has a reg. number, just so we\u2019re not gonna be sending our gift to something dodge) 3) we all look into the 10, comment/chat as we like, and then cast our votes, the well deserving winners get our gift to help out those of us on this planet struggling a little more than we are ! \n\nI think it would be pretty cool, when we have our charities, one of us writes a note to them , could do it  as a sub post with comments below, telling them who we are, why we\u2019re a community and wishing them the very best with our gift.\n\nAs to paying the money, I think we probably want to keep this process as simple and direct as possible.  I don\u2019t think any of us want an intermediary between our donations and the charities.  If we make our payments individually from us to the charities I think it would be cool for each of us to comment on here as we do it so we can keep a tally as a community and get a sense of what our contribution looks like.  Little doubt, in a few years time, paying direct in XRP to most organisations will be simple, however, if we reach our target soonish that may not be poss, also depending on the charity, suggest we keep it 1 XRP or 1XRP worth\n\nLastly, I just want to say, I don\u2019t at all mean to assume that we\u2019re all in the same boat in terms of our lifestyle, income, money etc.  This is a very diverse sub, which I think is what makes it a great forum.  Some people are new here, some people have modest xrp holdings, some have v significant holdings and are maybe a dollar away from life changing amounts.  However, I hope this gift to charity is done in a way where we all feel included.  The individual amount 1 XRP I think is modest on its own but as a v diverse growing community it becomes pretty cool\n\n",

The reason that XRP is burned during a transaction is to prevent spamming on the network.  And Ripple can change the number, so if it was being destroyed too fast, they would lower the mount. Ripple never intended the destroyed XRP to effect the price.  It was purely implemented to prevent spam (no one is going to spam a network if it costs them real money).  I have seen a chart that shows the progress of XRP destroyed over time, and it is so small, that it is not even a factor.    "

        "post_body": " What is Mello?\n\nThe Mello Token is a redistributive cryptocurrency built on Binance Smart Chain (BSC). The fast and inexpensive transactions of BSC make the Mello Token perfect for integration into our Virtual Reality Casino concept. A 3% redistribution fee is placed on all transfers, purchases, and sales of Mello (outside of exchanges) which is rewarded to all holders. Put simply, all holders of Mello earn rewards on a constant basis which will be eligible for play inside the Mello casino.  \n \n\nWhy Mello?  \n The Mello team has been equal parts meticulous and aggressive in the development process of their project thus far. The team has already shown their faces and are obviously committed... they have been checking off items from their roadmap one by one.  \n   \n \n\nEntering the enormous casino market with high transaction volume, the 3% redistribution has the potential to prove wildly beneficial for holders of Mello.  \n Launched a month ago and with a market cap of roughly $12 million, Mello Token has tons of room to grow.\n\n Building the casino\n\nThe first iteration Mello web Casino will launch by the end of Q3 / beginning of Q4, after which the team will be focusing their efforts on Virtual Reality development and partnerships. \n\nGammaStack Partnership\n\nMello recently announced a partnership with GammaStack.  \n GammaStack began operations a decade ago as a bespoke software development company, and today stands tall as an established IT solutions provider that has helped guide more than 500 clients across the world in building successful tech projects.\n\nGammastack offers tailored services which help organizations to accelerate the integration of the latest technology trends including AR and Blockchain integrations.\n\nMello is currently in the process of forming further partnerships which will help facilitate the development of other aspects of the Mello vision.\n\nThe first Mello Medium article was posted today, April 26th! \n\nCheck out our article on medium for a short read summarizing the story of Mello, our progress so far, and where we are headed in the near future!\n\n[https://mellotoken.medium.com/mello-token-our-story-8bce750d403a](https://mellotoken.medium.com/mello-token-our-story-8bce750d403a)\n\nCommunity involvement / Giveaway Competitions\n\nThe Mello team has continually been in contact with its community. We are always available in our voice channel on discord for any sort of queries and concerns. Our artists have been streaming their construction of 3D assets, and we have been holding frequent contests and giveaways as well.\n\nOur best meme contest ended today at 11am PST!

        "post_body": "Hi BTCP community,\n\nI'm Jay. I'm the CEO and lead developer of Nanex (https://nanex.co/), an exchange that is extremely well known in the Nano community that approaches the exchanging of digital assets differently, namely having Nano being the base pair instead of Bitcoin. We've been getting a lot of suggestions for other coins to add and BTCP stuck out to me.\n\nNormally I'm heavily wary of adding new Bitcoin forks, but this project seems like it may have some promise and many in the Nano community have expressed support for the idea and this project.\n\nI'm already working on getting in touch with the developers, but the developers can't tell me something the community can: whether or not this is even wanted. I won't list something if there isn't a desire for it.\n\nI believe that the Nano community has a lot of interest in this project being that it is a privacy coin, and it could be a very good pair.\n\nI won't lie to you and say we're a huge exchange or that we have a ton of volume. We aren't there yet, and we only launched a little over a month ago (with many months of development before then being followed closely by the Nano community - we were formerly known as RaiExchange). However, we have over 15,000 customers already, with ~150 new registrations per day.\n\nWe're looking to adopt new cryptocurrencies with promising tech, and hope that they can also in turn adopt us. A case in point was Garlicoin: joke/meme coin that it may be, they had a large community of friendly people new to crypto but no good exchanges. Much like BTCP, the only thing they had was TradeSatoshi. We listed them, and we've been doing anywhere from 25%-50% of their total volume and we've introduced tons of people new to crypto to trading and exchanging - despite the fact that they are paired with NANO and not BTC.\n\nOur customers love our exchange, whether they're brand new to crypto or if they're experienced traders.\n\nTo save you some time, here's some important points about Nanex:\n\n* We operate on a maker-taker fee schedule. Maker orders are free, and taker orders only pay a 0.2% fee.\n* Our withdrawal fees are generally the lowest in the industry.\n* We have the fastest exchange UI around, owing mainly to our single-page app user interface. Mobile support will be coming soon.\n* We have over 15,000 registered users and get 100-200 new registrations per day.\n* For those who care greatly about security (which I'm sure is many of you, considering this is a private coin), we're one of the only exchanges that supports U2F two-factor authentication. This means you can secure your account with a YubiKey, Trezor, or Ledger. This is just one of many other security considerations we've taken that many exchanges do not.\n* Withdrawal and deposit processing is a top concern of ours. Our nano wallet processes transactions in two seconds or less, and every other coin is always within 5 minutes.\n* Much like Binance, our entire system was built from the ground up for scalability and reliability. No matter how much load we get hit with, our system can handle it. It's too much to talk about in here, so if you're interested you can read some of my threads I've posted in the nano subreddit.\n* We currently list BTC, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Garlicoin (all paired with NANO)\n\nI'd love to hear all of your thoughts.",

I see XLM as a \"support\" coin/token intermediary, and not a value store, or at least the evidence points to this. I'm not an expert, but do own tens of thousands of XLM myself. We need projects that buy and store XLM as a value proposition, not an intermediary transfer mechanism."

One XRP can not be $5-25, there will only ever be a fixed number of XRP (in theory) in circulation while the rest is held which should drive up demand.

There's only been people here and on XMR trader shouting for months that exchanges directly invovled with new Tether prints are probably fractionally reserved. We've been explaining that they're probably using any real Monero on their exchanges to maintain leveraged shorts with price suppression. And that's in addition to the naked short that selling non-existent Monero actually is.\n\nIf you leave your XMR on BitFinex, Poloniex, Binance, Huobi, or any exchange that receives new Tether prints, you're hurting us. Use a *reputable* regulated exchange if you're gonna trade. Kraken is probably the best here, and they're very likely fully reserved. They're trying to integrate into the banking system, and generally can't afford to do those kinds of manipulation and lies.\n\nOr just use a decentralized exchange. Or better yet, *stop trading.* Most people get rekt doing it. We need to squeeze the shit out of liquidity on these price manipulators. It's time to put an end to this. They don't have loads of ASIC mined and premined Monero to dump on retail. They hate that they can't see the onchain flows. They want to suppress price and make Monero their own personal little laundromat.\n\nMonero is for *The People* not for a narrow set of corporate parasites.

        "post_body": "After months of work, we are happy to finally make public **Haveno**, the Monero based Decentralized Exchange!\n\nFor now it's only a Proof of Concept and the interface is still Bisq, but the base mechanisms are there and developers can already test XMR <-> Crypto trades!\n\n**Repository:** **https://github.com/haveno-dex/haveno**\n\n## What's happening?\nThe calls for a native, decentralized and private way to exchange Monero for fiat currencies and other cryptos have been heard! Haveno is a fork of the [Bisq exchange](https://bisq.network/), a decentralized exchange used to trade Bitcoin for national currencies and other cryptos. Haveno is based on Monero, making it **more private** and **cheaper** than Bisq (more info in the [README of the repository](https://github.com/haveno-dex/haveno).\n\nHaveno uses peer-to-peer networking and multi-signature escrow to facilitate trading without a trusted third party custodian. Disputes can be resolved using non-custodial arbitration.\n\nThe project has a core team, at the moment composed of myself (ErCiccione) and Woodser, the lead developer.\n\n## What's the status of the project\nThe platform has a long road to go before being available for public use. As said, the PoC is ready, but everything else needs to be done. We are tracking development using GitHub's issues and projects. Please take a look at  the ['Status of the project' section of the README](https://github.com/haveno-dex/haveno#status-of-the-project), but basically the most important tasks we are working on are:\n\n- **We need a logo**. Right now it's a random stock image ([#1](https://github.com/haveno-dex/haveno-meta/issues/1))\n- **The User Interface is basically still Bisq**. Needs to be completely reworked and adapted for Monero as base currency (https://github.com/haveno-dex/haveno/projects/2). We are already in contact with an interested designer, but nothing has been decided yet.\n- **Clean-up the repository** from Bisq-specific content (https://github.com/haveno-dex/haveno/projects/1)\n\n## How can the community help?\nNow we badly need:\n\n- Contributors\n- Funds\n\nIf you can help in any way, please let us know. Right now we mostly need coders (Java), network experts (for the underlying P2P/Tor infrastructure) and designers, but any help in any field would be really appreciated. Just contact us and let's build Haveno together!\n\n**Funds are also fundamental at this stage**. If you can, please [sponsor](https://github.com/haveno-dex/haveno#sponsors) or [donate](https://github.com/haveno-dex/haveno#support) to the project. We are thinking of incentive development through bounties, but we will also need funds to continue development. We are also considering opening a CCS proposal, but that will be decided later on, also depending by how much funds we are going to get without CCS.\n\n## Where are we?\nThe [haveno-dex GitHub organization](https://github.com/haveno-dex) is our base. The main repository where the code sleeps is [haveno](https://github.com/haveno-dex/haveno), but we also have a [haveno-meta](https://github.com/haveno-dex/haveno-meta) repository, used for proposals and project-wide issues/features that need to be added/discussed.\n\nWe have two rooms on Matrix, where we discuss and coordinate:\n\n- **Haveno** (`#haveno:haveno.network` - [invite link](https://matrix.to/#/!IEFpSeJArnlszBCPzh:haveno.network?via=haveno.network): For general discussions about the project (relayed on Freenode: `#haveno`)\n- **Haveno Dev** (`#haveno-dev:haveno.network` - [Invite link](https://matrix.to/#/!HeVhOlajgOuVMOKhvS:haveno.network?via=haveno.network&via=monero.social&via=matrix.org)): For development related coordination and support (relayed on Freenode: `#haveno-dev`)\n\n## The question everybody want to ask\nYes, Woodser is already working in implementing atomic swaps for XMR <-> BTC trades on Haveno :)\n\nWe are very excited to finally go public and we are looking forward to hear your thoughts! :)",

The legitimacy that is coming through IOTA is beneficial for every project in the space.\n\nNow, it seems like they created a rule against these things. New members to foundations. \n\nThis rule is dumb as f*** and looks like it's tailored especially for IOTA since IOTA's most important news is that companies work with IOTA, they join the IOTA Foundation. It's building a great basis for what's about to come. \nThis is real-world adoption in the making. \n\nThe reason behind the rule of the /r/cc is, IMO, completely nuts, and was made to stop IOTA from finding investors and devs. \n\nIOTA has many enemies, due to the lack of mining, the zero fee model and last but not least: the scalability. \n\nIf anyone thinks these are just conspiracies, you may have forgotten that IOTA faces serious allegations that were based on lies, with the vulnerability report. \n\nDozens of enemies in social media, Bitcoin maximalists, \"alleged professors\" are still salty and use every occasion to spread misinformation against IOTA. \n\nThis is the reality. \n\nThe earliest adopters of Bitcoin back in the days started the subreddit /r/cryptocurrency, so naturally, they are mostly Bitcoin believers.\n\nBut between us, nano gets also general support from them.  \n\nI, personally, will boycott this subreddit. \n\nI won't participate, I won't retweet, I won't vote or interact in any possible way. \nAs long as they didn't sort out their stupid anti-IOTA rules that harm adoption for IOTA, and in the end the reputation of the whole space as it makes it look like a centralized tyranny. \n\n10 people decide what 650.000 people can read. Let that sink in. \n\nThat doesn't sound like a barrier-free solution we try to achieve with all of this.

        "post_body": "At this point everyone knows what crypto is or has at least heard of it in some capacity. I was one of those people who was happy to sit on the sideline and invest my money into other non-crypto assets. \n\nFor some reason I got interested in Dogecoin because lolmemes. Once I dug a little deeper into DOGE I realized there were no real fundamentals or business plan behind the coin. It is literally just a coin the exists for the sake of existing \n\nSo I set out to find crypto that had an interesting business behind it to support the coin. After researching two dozen different coins I realized that most were heavy on buzzwords but light on substance \n\nFinally I dug into Tron. It has a lofty business plan but at least it is something I could understand. Decentralized internet and P2P sharing is something I am familiar with and it seems like Tron is well positioned in China, one of the largest markets in the world. \n\nSo I took the plunge. At 4,000 units my initial investment isn\u2019t large but I feel like it\u2019s a good start. Over time I plan to acquire more TRX. I\u2019m not looking for a quick pump and dump I\u2019m looking for a coin with a solid business plan that will grow over a mid to long-term time horizon. \n\nAnyways figured I\u2019d share my story. If a random crypto newbie like me can steer clear of traps like Dogecoin and find a solid coin like TRX I\u2019m hopeful that more people will see the value in not only the coin but the underlying business.",

The app will launch a bit later this summer, and we have many big plans to make Stellar as a whole more popular, more user-friendly, and more successful. \n\nYou can read a more in our [Medium post](https://medium.com/stellarxhq/announcing-stellarx-7dd62c168c2f).

Its wrong and its taking advantage of the EOS community for their own personal gain. Not to mention its an extremely unprofessional way to run a business. \n\nIf BPs can do whatever they want and get away with it, this project is doomed. EOS Nation should be voted out, so maybe BPs will be insentivised to act with more integrity in the future. \n\n\n--- \n\n\n## Edit: \nThank you EOS Nation for responding. I am including their response in this post becauss my perception of the situation may not be completely correct and there are two sides to every story. Its only fair to allow both sides to have a voice. \n\n## EOS Nation's response: \n\n> Yes, EOS Nation did sell a portion of our RAM recently. We have been very transparent with our RAM purchases, discussing in our EOS Nation channel, in our bi-weekly live Discord AMA, as well as in the EMLG channel.\n\n> You can track all of our RAM purchases as we made them using our BP account (eosnationftw) - I also invite you to go check our \"eosnationair\" RAM account which currently has 27,356.59 KB of RAM in it.\n\n> Upon learning about the RAM Allocation Market, the day of Dan's Dawn 4.0 medium article release, EOS Nation wrote an article highlighting this new feature. (https://steemit.com/eos/@eosnation/block-producers-can-potentially-be-zero-cost-to-the-network).\n\n> We knew RAM would be precious for future projects, and so, upon being able to purchase RAM, we purchased a total of 119MB.\n\n> After Thurday's June 28th livestream call and the recent discussions in the public telegram channels, it is clear that the RAM market is being looked at closely, so we've decided to sell a portion to invest in community projects that we are working. The RAM we did keep, in our eosnationair account, is for the Airdrop we are working on. EOS Nation expected RAM to increase in value as we started with near 0% RAM use, there was no way RAM would ever be as cheap again, so we purchased our RAM right away. We don't know where the price of RAM will stabilize. No one knows how much RAM will be needed for projects, but we know we need some for the Airdrop, and for a possible telegram bot, as it will require multiple account creations (the only baseline we have is the 19,000 EOS spent to create the roughly ~163,000 original accounts for users). We've also seen a couple of airdrops \"fizz out\" (or so it seems) because they ran out of RAM, so we want to keep a good amount to avoid this from happening.\n\n> As stated above, EOS Nation sold a portion of our RAM recently, roughly 12 hours after the livestream BP call so as to give a chance to the market to react and clear any advantage we may have had as a StandBy Block Procuder.(the call was livestreamed publicly and people talked about it all day)",

On the surface the link looks totally legit; the human-readable text points to the ipfs.io/ipfs/... but the hypertext address that you get sent to has a different domain lpfs.io - did you notice the difference?\n\nThe correct link starts with the letter I while the bogus one starts with the letter L. In lowercase text, they're almost impossible to tell apart unless you look really closely.\n\nOur friend WillRog78 is even smart enough that if you enter the root scammer domain, it redirects to the valid one. It's only if you enter the full link that you get served a scamming web page that is a complete replica of the authentic seed generator.\n\nWithin hours of making a deposit using one of these seeds, your funds will be withdrawn and stolen from under your nose. All by someone posing as a \"helpful\" person out to assist the community. This post has been upvoted nearly 3,000 times so I can only imagine that hundreds of folks have used the site and many of these have had their funds stolen.\n\nMy young friend just had 3Gi stolen from his wallet because I shared the link to this so-called \"help manual\" - money he could ill afford to lose and I'm guessing that many of the folks reporting lost funds may also have been victims of this scam. \n\nPLEASE HELP TRACK THIS CROOK DOWN AND LET'S STOP OTHERS FROM HAVING THEIR MONEY STOLEN TOO.\n\nIt's criminal activities like this that make new investors scared to work with Iota. If anyone knows of a way to track the funds, please let me know. I have the bundle and hash info for the confirmed withdrawal if it would help.\n\nDON'T GET SCAMMED. BE SAFE OUT THERE.\n\nEDIT: The phishing link has been taken down and the link corrected to the correct domain. I still advise people not to trust online seed generators and to use an offline method such as KeePass2. Even then, I suggest manually editing 5-10 characters of the generated seed just to guarantee that there is no way your seed could be compromised.\n\nEDIT: I have changed the post so the link is no longer clickable. I also informed both Dom and David about this scam and received a thank you email back. No word from anyone if there's a way to \"follow the money\" trail and freeze the funds or to reimburse those who can prove that they were victims. If anyone has ideas about how we could trace these bastards and bring them to justice, please let me know. I don't even know which law enforcement agency would even have jurisdiction in a case like this.\n\n",

        "body": "i'm calling bullshit here... the withdrawal fee from HitBTC alone would have eaten that 31% up before you even got it to binance. \n\nThis is risky information to give to new traders considering the BCN dev team even said that wallets were having issues and exchanges were having deposit/withdrawal issues. You're taking a huge risk sending coins over during that time since you have no idea how many pending transactions will clear before yours. The price could even out way before your transaction goes through.\n\nThe only time arb ever worked for me was with BTG when it first started trading on the Korean exchange Bithumb. It was trading at like $1600 there while it was only $300ish everywhere else, and since BTG was still brand new, there were also issues with transactions not going through fast enough. I sold everything I had on HitBTC into BTG, made an account on Bithumb and sent it over, checked obsessively for hours for the transaction to clear... finally after about 6 hours it went through, along with just about every other transaction from others trying to arb. The price was at like $1300 when my transaction first went through and instead of selling that second, i refreshed the page to see if it would change again... in just those precious seconds it went down to $900. I was able to get my sell order in right around there and ended up with a 3x profit in BTC value. Had I waited another 10 seconds or so it would have gone down to $600, then $500. After the rush of that trade wore off I realized something I didn't think of. Bithumb requires Korean identification for verified accounts. I started to panic thinking my money would be stuck there forever. Started thinking I might have to move to Korea and open a bank account there just to be able to withdraw... I tried to withdraw anyway and send it back to my account on HitBTC overnight. Barely slept a wink thinking i really fucked up and my money was gonna be in limbo forever. \n\nHowever, by some miracle, the transaction completed and I was able to withdraw without issue from bithumb even though I was unverified. The whole ordeal probably gave me twice as much gray hair as I had before, but in the end it worked out. \n\nTL;DR, arbitrage is risky business, especially when the coin or exchange is having problems with withdrawals and deposits. it's like 10x the gamble that trading cryptos is in the first place. I was dumb for putting my whole nut into one trade, but luckily it worked out for me. Don't be stupid... or if you are gonna be stupid, don't be mad when it doesn't work for you."

        "post_body": "Countless times, both here and elsewhere, I have seen people ask the question of what the opening price of BTCP will be. I even saw the question coming up during the conference livestream comments earlier. The question itself betrays a misconception of opening price, so I have decided to explain it here.\nThe opening price of a new market product is not \"set\" or otherwise determined in a deliberate fashion; the market sets it. What does that mean? Well, consider that as the product becomes available, there is zero liquidity, meaning that there are not yet any units on sale, hence, there is not price. Someone who owns the product will create liquidity by placing a sell order for whatever price he desires. It is important to note that such an initial offer is not necessarily related in any way to the value of the product; the first sell order for BTCP could be something preposterous, like 1 BTC.\nThen more orders will be created by people who feel that they can offer something lower, thus beating out the original offer. At some point, somebody will take an offer by placing a buy order that meets the lowest sell order, resulting in the first exchange. Most exchanges give a current price reading based on the last exchange. Ergo, the price of the first BTCP exchange will be the opening price of the coin. Alternatively, we could imagine that the opening price is whatever is being asked for it at the lowest price, no matter how outrageous.\nThe point is that the coin will only be worth as little as people are willing to let it go for. If everyone sees the first few trades go off at an unexpectedly low price, they may panic and sell for the same low price. To do so would be to act on the assumption that the first few traders who sold had an accurate idea of the product value, even though what is actually being looked at is a tiny sample of potential sellers who were prepared to offer the least. The true value is very unlikely to be anywhere near such an initial guess by a puny fraction of the stake holders.\nMany traders will probably want to leave their positions immediately, and will therefore dump their BTCP out of the gate. It would, however, be a grave error to mistake the prices these traders dump at for the value of the product. This is not to say that one should never sell; one might think one's position can be increased by dumping and then buying back in at reduced prices... After this commencement phase, the market will begin to search for the true value of the product. It is important that potential sellers should be aware of these dynamics, so that they don't get drawn in by initial sell-offs and thus reduce the price (and most likely do themselves out of some money).\n\nPS, I originally posted this on the ZCL thread, and have reposted it here.",

Decentralized technology could play a key role in the Connected Car of the future.\nAfter the automotive supplier Bosch had already invested in the young crypto company IOTA last year, Volkswagen is now announcing its cooperation with the people of Berlin. At the Bosch Connected World Conference, Volkswagen CDO Johann Jungwirth will explain the potential of free technology.\nIn contrast to conventional blockchain solutions, IOTA relies on a blockless tangle system, which is especially advantageous in the Internet of Things in combination with countless endpoints. Transactions are validated by confirming other transfers. For example, each transaction must first validate two additional transactions in the IOTA network to be valid. Therefore, an IOTA-based network is becoming more and more efficient in contrast to traditional blockchain solutions with an increasing number of subscribers. At the same time, thanks to successive validation in the network, the security of normal block chain solutions is maintained.\n\nIn addition, IOTA's structure allows transactions to be exchanged free of charge and confirmed in the shortest possible time. The technology also works offline and promises quantum security.\nIOTA in the Connected Car\nIn practice, IOTA could be used in new connected car systems, for example to secure the distribution of OTA software updates. In addition, it is also conceivable to use MaaS solutions (mobility as a service), as Jungwirth explains on Twitter.\nAs part of the partnership, Jungwirth also joins the board of directors of the IOTA Foundation. His task will be to monitor the Foundation's annual roadmap and advise on future cooperation between IOTA and Volkswagen. The position on the Supervisory Board also includes approval of annual budgets and review of the IOTA Foundation's Board of Directors."

        "post_body": "For what it's worth, I thought I might weigh in on tron's overall vision and offer some insight on how I think Tron's platform would reshape the game industry.\n\nAfter successfully installing and running the open source java-tron git project upon release, I could clearly see that the project wasn't just hype. This was the real deal and not only that, it was being built by an all-star team of passionate developers with their sights set on changing the way online games with in-game marketplaces and economies function in terms of how their content is created, stored, and traded via blockchain technology.\n\nThe basic idea is very clearly laid out in Tron Dogs. Think of it as a woof of concept. Heh. To break it down, the way Tron will change the game industry has to do with how it provides developers with a secure blockchain platform to allow players to own digital assets, such as Tron Dogs, and trade them via the Tron network in a way that cannot be compromised, just like all crypto-currencies. Furthermore, by utilizing the Tron network across multiple games, players will have the ability to earn Tron in Game A (i.e. perhaps for completing a quest or selling a Tron Sword) and then use that Tron in Game B (perhaps to buy body armor or a faster car).\n\nThese sorts of microtransactions have shaped the mobile game industry and although I personally dislike games with such mechanics, I cannot deny their profitability. Companies such as Gree, DeNA, Zynga, King, etc have made billions on microtransactions alone, not to mention actual game companies such as Rockstar and Valve with their in-game purchases netting them billions as well. There is definitely something to the idea of limited edition digital assets that carry value. Look at skins on CS:GO for example. If those were on the Tron network and secured via the blockchain, there would be an online marketplace for trading/selling them for Tron instead of fiat, which is highly desirable for a number of reasons, especially to game developers.\n\nI see the Tron network as THE future marketplace for the mobile game industry, which is absolutely booming in China, Korea, and Japan, as well as the US. Due to the obvious potential here, I've actually myself become very interested in being one of the first companies to build a game utilizing the Tron network. Getting in \"on the ground floor\" here is something that excites me and I look forward to seeing more updates to the git and welcome the launch of testnet. I'd also encourage any other game developers here on this sub with a stake in Tron to dive into the code on the git and start to familiarize yourself with the network as it may very well be the way of the future for online games with in-game marketplaces.\n\nThat's my take on how Tron relates to games and how I think it'll shape the future of gaming but as for the rest of the applications for the entertainment industry, I'm still trying to piece it together so I welcome any comments on the other ways the Tron network will come into play for content creators.\n\n\ud83c\udfae\n\nEDIT: For those of you who wanted proof I'm an actual game developer, I developed a game on Steam called Influent and am currently at PAX South exhibiting my upcoming game for PS4, XB1, and Steam called Armed and Gelatinous. Trying to upload a photo but I think the volume of people here is making my phone signal crap out.\n\nEDIT 2: A number of people have pointed out that Tron is not the only cryptocurrency targeting the game space. I was aware of Gamecredits but hadn't heard of Refereum or MANA before posting, which are both interesting especially given Refereum's apparent partnerships with unity and twitch. Gonna do some research on these and likely post again soon comparing them all to the Tron Network.\n\nEDIT 3: Also wanted to add some thoughts from a comment below...\n> With the ability to trade/sell an owned asset from an in-game inventory for Tron and use that currency elsewhere means that your in-game assets still retain value after purchase. Buying some in-game currency is currently one-way and as a result, most users don't become paid users. However if one could \"cash-out\" so to speak, they might be more interested in buying into the game. Imagine if you obtain a weapon either through killing an opponent, finding it in-game, or trading for it and that weapon increases in value in the in-game marketplace over time. You can now sell it to another player for Tron and profit. Eve Online has a system like this that some players have made small fortunes on. Also IIRC, Eve experienced some issues with their in-game currency that blockchain tech could have prevented.\n\nEDIT 4: It appears that some of these other game-related currencies have the very same idea as I've detailed above. Enjin Coin specifically caught my attention given their overall reach within the gaming community. I think Tron is perhaps aiming to accomplish the same goals in the Chinese gaming marketplace as well as perhaps Japan and Korea. The other goals of Tron in the entertainment space overall still set it apart but it's certainly not the only currency attempting to change the gaming industry and I'm actually quite excited to see that others are moving in the same direction. I'll be posting again soon in regard to my findings after researching these other coins in depth. Cheers for all the feedback everyone!",

        "post_body": "For a while I wanted to invest into Monero, not so much for the gains in the short to medium term, but for the long run. I believe that within this crypto circus we dwell in, one can truly find ways to store one\u2019s fortune in the most private and secure way, and in complete and utter contrast to the methods the bank system in the old world, have  forcibly put upon us.  I am of the opinion that we now live in an age, where we have given up way too much information of our own private financial  life, information which many times is used against us by those who have obtained it.  The old world has noticed us, and slowly but surely, is penetrating this world, spreading it\u2019s destructive ways, trying to gain control.  \n\nI feel now is the right time to start to move forward with my original plan, and so I started to really dig into the world of all those projects that not only provide speed and convenience  at low fees, but also privacy at the levels I feel are required for the present and of course for the future. \nI took a very close look at Monero, ZCash, Dash, Pivx, and Bytecoin BCN,  and though they each offer an overall very good level of privacy, they lacked one thing that to me seems so  trivial, yet was not included in any of them : TOR ! \n\n\uf0e8> Full table comparing all coins : http://imgur.com/a/nodcN\n\nWhat I felt was missing was for the  wallet itself to run  within TOR, the anonymity network, in order to make sure that all in and out traffic from one\u2019s wallet, goes through the TOR network. This in exchange, provides another level of solid anonymity on-line, censorship circumvention and network privacy,  one that has not been broken and is used and tested daily by millions.  \n\n\u201cTor hides the network traffic to and from your computer when you transact on the blockchain. Without using something like Tor, an actor with the ability to monitor a large proportion of the Internet (e.g. your government) can easily tell where the transaction originated, by seeing where the first broadcast of the transaction appeared. By using Tor this type of tracking is made virtually impossible.\u201d \u2013 quoting the lead developer of Spectrecoin.\n\nThree projects came up that provide what I was looking for: VERGE (XVG), Spectrecoin (XSPEC) and Signatum (SIGC).  The latter is now obsolete (\u201cThe dev abandoned project after too much pressure for a proper release. We have removed SIGC from the pool and cut our losses.\"  bitcointalk.org/ August 18, 2017), which leaves two projects, both I found to be very active with a serious supporting community behind them, and with an impressive outlook and development so far. \n\nAfter spending time with both lead developers of both teams, as well as getting a better idea from their communities, on how the projects have progressed in the recent period, my conclusions are that they are pretty similar. Both are led by very dedicated developers, who have a deep knowledge of the topic of crypto privacy, and who are eager to deliver the perfect solution and please their hungry, loyal and excited communities.  The XSPEC community especially impressed me with their friendly attitude and willingness to share information. The technical specs on both are impressive, with the VERGE adding i2p support and a few more neat options, and XSPEC providing working stealth addresses (yes, your address does not show up on the explorer!) with extra features in the near future. \n\nI asked the lead developer of Spectrecoin, Jansen Garrick, to provide a little explanation regarding the stealth address included as part of the project \u201cSpectre coins can be \"minted\" to Spectre tokens. When the tokens are spent, the input of the transaction is a ring signature over many tokens of the same value held by different people. This makes it impossible to know which of the tokens was the actual source of the funds.. Spectre tokens are held in \"stealth\" addresses.\u201d\n\nAnother interesting unique feature, or even, bonus, is that there are no fees associated to sending XSPEC, and of course.. it does go from X to Y in 30 seconds on average!\n\nAt this stage, I was left with one point only to truly use as my final decision maker: value of the coin and it\u2019s market cap. : \n\nIn the past week, XSPEC has risen by 138.60%, and in  the past month by 194.55%.  Market cap is 13 million! Potential is huge. The entire \u201cprivacy coin\u201d sector is gaining fast in the last week, but all of them have large to huge market caps, which does in some sense, limit the size of the gains one can expect. I will type this again: $13,000,000 market cap!  Current price is below 70 cents! \n\nBased on all my findings, as well as a raw view of the coin\u2019s financial situation, is it clear to me that Spectrecoin (XSPEC) is the privacy coin I want to invest in now.  On a technological standpoint, it is impressive compared to the other five big coins. With it\u2019s tiny market cap and steady growth, I feel the potential here is huge for both the short to medium run, and of course, the very long run, where it is important, in my opinion, to be able to achieve some level of privacy in this crypto circus we dwell in. \n\nTrading here : \nhttps://www.cryptopia.co.nz/Exchange/?market=XSPEC_BTC\n\nEDIT: \n\nXSPEC has got great news coming out\nrelease of a new v1.4 client with user-friendly intuitive GUI and functionality (so far, from the words of dev team lead: they are on point regarding release dates)\nPeople can read full press-release there https://blog.spectreproject.io/spectrecoin-v-1-33-to-v-1-4-update-c84f7e4a9aa\n\nReddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/XSPEC\n",

It's absolutely absurd. When someone says \"It's not J.P.

But, some of these little banks are more than what they look like, 7-Bank - Owners of 7-11, Aeon - Heavily used service that travelers use to get yen on the spot, Shinkin Central Bank - They hold ALOT of yen (they kind of act like a reserve in a way), Sony Bank - it is a direct bank so no branches or ATM's\n\n7-11's are already a go to place to pay for utility bills, phone bills, and others. These little convenience stores will serve as a 24/7 Brick and mortar location for people to what ever financial service they need done. \n\nAeon, Travelers use their ATM's to exchange foreign currencies to yen on the spot. Already located in Airports around Japan, perfect use case for xRapid.\n\nShinkin, not much info about it but, they play a key role in Japaneses financial industry.\n\nSony Bank, yes its associated with Sony Electronics. My best guess here is that this bank serves as part of Sony's world wide payment infrastructure.\n\nYou guys have been overlooking this for so long. SBI is literally behind SO many financial institutions in Japan, they pretty much have a monopoly on the money services there. With all of these Banks operating under SBI, once SBI VC is launched and once SBI puts xRapid into production. We will moon.\n\nI encourage ALL of you to take a second and dig just a little deeper then you guys do. Most people on here just listen to all the news that Youtube, Twitter, and Reddit rehashes over and over again. There is plenty of info, buried out there, between the lines, or staring you in the fricking face that no one has talked about yet.

This means more energy consumption if the price goes up over time and less energy consumption if the price goes down over time. I think it's safe to assume that if a coin is successful, the price goes up over time or at least not down.\n\nBut you're right if you look per transaction. But wouldn't the fact that Dash can serve more people mean that it also has a potential for an even higher market cap, if it would displace BTC as the #1?\n\nI think ultimately if we're concerned about energy use, we should have a plan to continue reducing the miner share as the market cap goes up. Or to transition away from PoW entire. As is, I think it's hard to argue that Dash is the best alternative for someone who worries about energy use of cryptocurrencies."

        "post_title": "The Case for XRP in 2018",
        "post_body": "Cryptocurrencies have grown exponentially not only in price this past year but also in public awareness and popular attention. The novel feeling to an emerging financial and technological market is reminiscent of the rise of the Internet with its innovative potential. In turn, a heightened collective societal awareness of this new innovative potential has led to a change in the nature of the market dynamics of cryptocurrencies. As Heisenberg\u2019s Uncertainty Principle posits, \u201cThe observation of a phenomenon changes the phenomena itself.\u201d The observation of thousands of young millennials, and now middle-aged investors, will only accelerate the rise of cryptocurrencies as times goes on.\n\nToday, we are seeing the real-world effects of a newfound intrigue into cryptocurrencies. This new interest is causing a narrowing of the divergence between truth and fiction over accurate knowledge about cryptocurrencies. The force drawing this gap narrower each day is an increased dissemination of truthful information that has generated legions of individual investors into new cryptocurrency markets; in particular, Ripple\u2019s XRP.\n\nAs the public expands its understanding of Ripple\u2019s XRP, the capital inflow from both individual and institutional investors combined will likely grow to levels that will exponentially grow the liquidity of XRP and, as a byproduct, its price.\n\nHere, in this report, I will provide an overview and analysis of Ripple\u2019s XRP and the implications Q4 2017 and the year 2018 and beyond hold for the future of XRP and its price.\n\n**THE CONCEPT: WHAT IS XRP?**\n\nXRP is the digital asset used by Ripple to offer financial institutions an option for liquidity to conduct cross-border payments. It is predominantly used for Ripple\u2019s solution for the minimization of liquidity costs. In contrast to most other cryptocurrencies, XRP\u2019s application here features a real-world applicability that extends to real-world transactions.  It is used for the xRapid solution provided by Ripple, and is the only one of the three solutions Ripple offers (The others are xCurrent and xVia) that employs the use of XRP.\n\n**THE RATIONALE: WHY XRP?**\n\nThere is a myriad of factors that distinguish XRP from other cryptocurrencies and establish it as a forerunner to what may become the dominant cryptocurrencies in the years that lie ahead.\n\nCost: Comparatively, XRP has the lowest cost per transaction at $0.0004. In contrast, BCH is $0.26, LTC is $0.37, DASH is $0.64, ETH is $0.96, and BTC is $28.23.\n\nScalability: XRP can handle over 1,500 transactions per second whereas BCH can handle 24 per second, LTC can handle 56 per second, DASH can handle 10 per second, ETH can handle 16 per second, and BTC can handle 24 per second.\n\nSpeed: XRP can conduct transactions at a rate of 3 seconds per transaction, BCH at a rate of 58 minutes per transaction, LTC at 17 minutes per transaction, DASH at 15 minutes per transaction, ETH at 2 minutes per transaction, and BTC 1 hour and 6 minutes per transaction.\n\nXRP\u2019s availability is ever-expanding. It is currently available on over 50 exchanges including Bitstamp, Bithumb, Bittrex, Binance, Bitfinex, Kraken, and Poloniex. The volume of XRP availability is, in addition, in an expansionary phase. The primary location of exchange volume is concentrated in Asia; in particular, South Korea. However, as mainstream media attention increases, so will American interest as well. There already have been tell-tale signs indicative in news outlets that have covered Ripple recently in the wake of XRP\u2019s rise in CNBC, Bloomberg, Forbes, Investopedia, and Yahoo Finance.\n\nSimply consider the mania generated by the media attention to Bitcoin. Repetitive news stories featured on CNBC, Bloomberg, CNN, CBS, and other mainstream media news outlets. Countless articles disparaging it as a bubble and hailing it as a force that could deconstruct the financial apparatus governed by the Federal Reserve and other central banks. Now, consider the results of media attention directed towards the substantive information behind XRP. Once news segments and articles are shown and written that illustrate the comparative superiority of XRP to other cryptocurrencies, then the viewers and readers will likely flock to XRP in pursuit of acquiring a tried, tested, and proven cryptocurrency with real-world usage.\n\nIn turn, a virtuous circle intensifying capital inflow to XRP is predictable and probably to occur. We can expect FOMO to rise and a number of oscillations up and down for the price to unfold. Nevertheless, the price of XRP is bound to not only remain but rather accelerate its demonstrated upwards price trajectory pushing us to new heights.\n\nAdditionally, if the collective fear among cryptocurrency investors materializes, that is, if new regulations are imposed on our activities, then Ripple is stand to likely gain. Dr. Nassim Nicholas Taleb, a scholar and risk analyst writes about a concept called \u201cAntifragility.\u201d Antifragility is a term used to describe things that gain from disorder. Considering Ripple\u2019s ties to financial institutions and regulators, it wouldn\u2019t be too far-off to speculate that XRP is positioned to gain if such a black swan event were to occur.\n\n**FURTHER REASONS TO ADVANCE THE CASE FOR XRP:**\n\nFinancial institutions, renown investors, and accomplished financiers have already taken notice of XRP. Former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke has advocated on Ripple\u2019s behalf. Zoe Cruz, former president for institutional securities and wealth management at Morgan Stanley and former global head of fixed income, commodities, and foreign exchange has joined Ripple\u2019s Board of Directors. She has been named to Forbes list of Most Powerful Women for three years straight.\n\nPerhaps most notably, a consortium of 61 banks \u2013 organized by SBI Ripple Asia \u2013 will be adopting Ripple\u2019s technology to settle transactions between its members with the eventual goal of applying XRP to usage. Mr. Yoshitaka Kitao, the CEO, Executive Chairman, and President has publicly stated, \u201cForget about bitcoin, we\u2019re all in on XRP!\u201d  In fact, SBI has already confirmed that XRP will be put in usage in Spring 2018. If successful, expect the price to reflect it.\n\nMoreover, TechCrunch Founder Michael Arrington has, as of November 2017, announced a $100 million XRP hedge fund. His efforts have already raised $50 million which will engender a ripple effect of new large net-worth individual and institutional investors. The entity will be called Arrington XRP Capital and new information about its activities are set to be released in the months that lie ahead.\n\nAlso, David Schwartz, Ripple\u2019s Chief Cryptographer, has said that there are two major \u201chousehold\u201d companies (Not financial institutions) that will be announced in Q4. This is likely to provide a substantial boon to XRP.\n\nFinally, the Chief Technology Officer of Ripple, Stefan Thomas, has said that in 2018 there will be a \u201cbig push on XRP.\u201d For years, Ripple has kept a relative silence in expressing the superiority of XRP. 2018 will be different. 2018 is bound to be Ripple\u2019s year. **I expect the price to rise as high as $10** and as low as $4. \n\nAt any rate, this report only scratches the surface of Ripple and XRP\u2019s potential. For far more nuanced and in-depth analysis and information, I suggest reading from Ripple firsthand at www.ripple.com and perusing the best blog on XRP itself at https://xrphodor.wordpress.com/\n\nTo the moon, we go.\n\nSOURCE: https://cellardoorway.com/2017/12/24/the-case-for-ripples-xrp-a-brief-overview/",

Because a couple people predict september,  some sell off in this month to avoid losses, other one will also sell  earlier in order to get save and more and more will follow to take their  profits or cut losses. This could result in a chainreaction ending in  the actual end of the bullrun.

        "post_body": "Yes, the EOS price is down. Dan and Brendan are not scammers--Block.one is constantly upgrading the eosio software, like every several weeks there are new updates with their latest release this past week. The EOS mainnet just saw an increase to \\~4,500 transactions per second this past week.\n\n[Block.one](https://block.one/)\u00a0and EOSVC are still funding new investments that will leverage eosio. They just invested in a btc software company to use eosio. If these startups/companies want to use an eosio blockchain with the most liquidity, security, transparency, and decentralization, they will be wise to use the EOS mainnet.\n\nThe EOS mainnet is seeing some great developments and dApp deployments. Vigor, DAPP Network, Sense Chat, Chirp, PredIQT, deWeb, EOS Options, and pixeos marketplace are some prime examples of developers attracted to the EOS mainnet.\n\nLet's talk about competitors. Cardano is launching Shelley but still has 2 MORE phases to go before they can launch their actual mainnet. Cardano has no dApps, no real transactions (because everything is still on their testnet), and they have no real-world stress tests on their nonexistent mainnet.\n\nEthereum 2.0 is delayed and a head developer at the Ethereum Foundation stated that he believes Eth 2.0 will be launched in the Spring of 2021.\n\nAvalanche, which purports to have solved Ethereum's defi scalability issues, just witnessed a massive DDOS attack on their public crowdsale last week and are now forced to push it back to next week.\n\nChainlink is valuable, but the DAPP Network can enhance its capabilities and effectiveness.\n\nTezos still has legal issues/$$ settlement, has no dApps of substance, are delusional when they say that they have solved governance through their liquid proof of stake (there are still large entities that control Tezos), and have a high annual inflation that hurts the value for token holders.\n\nWhy are developers not flocking to EOS in droves?\n\nMarketing and Money. The eosio tech is superior. I develop on both Ethereum and EOS, and have seen first-hand which is the better tech. But blockchain technology in general needs to be far more scalable and faster to rival centralized database technologies like AWS and Azure.\n\nMarketing of EOSIO needs to be better, but the EOSIO software needs to be ready for prime time. No blockchain is ready for primetime. Not Cardano, not Ethereum, not Tezos, not Chainlink, and any of the other top-20 blockchains out there.\u00a0[Block.one](https://block.one/)\u00a0is smart not to waste money on marketing EOS to pump the price, unlike other crypto projects (all hype, no substance). Once EOSIO is ready, which I foresee in the next 18 months, they would be hard-pressed not to market the shit out of it.\n\nMoney. Developers like Ethereum because of the large pockets of VCs and other entities like Consensys or the Ethereum Foundation that can fund their projects. Ethereum developers have a way easier time in receiving funding with half-baked ideas.\u00a0[Block.one](https://block.one/)\u00a0is not as generous in doling out funding and have many regulations and rules on who can apply. But,\u00a0[Block.one](https://block.one/)\u00a0has poured in millions of dollars into dApps, which are now starting to come to fruition. Look at Everipedia's PredIQT, Sense Chat, Upland, Mythical Games' Blankos, WordProof, and Voice.\n\nSide note, Consensys has been forced to cut their developer workforce twice in the past 18 months. They trimmed their staff by about 30%. OTOH,\u00a0[Block.one](https://block.one/)\u00a0has been on a hiring spree and has a count of over 300 developers across 4 offices in Asia and the US.",

And then I'd have to start looking for patterns.\n\nNow, I find a pattern. Now, to guess your seed, I start bruteforcing combos, while ignoring ones that don't fit the pattern. Let's say that this is half (very generous). I've cut the number of seeds I have to try by half. The number of seeds was already very large, and although cutting it in half was also very large, it's still a large number of seeds, and pretty impractical to try to brute force."

        "post_body": "A new age of community participation is about to start on the IOTA network. A decision has to be made about what will happen to a total of about 60 Terra-IOTA (= 60,000,000 MIOTA, currently worth around 50 million USD) that lie dormant on the IOTA 1.0 network. This decision will be made by YOU and the rest of the IOTA community. All token holders will be able to vote for this important decision directly inside their Firefly wallets. The two options are:\n\na) BUILD with these tokens (spend them on community projects)\n\nb) BURN those tokens (lock them away so nobody will ever be able to use them)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Where do these 60 Ti come from?**\n\nMost of the tokens at stake were sold at IOTAs original crowd-sale in 2016, but were never claimed by their respective buyers. Others remain unclaimed since a network-transition in the beginnings of 2017. After five years of trying to find the owners the IOTA Foundation gave out a final deadline to claim these tokens, pledging to give the remaining ones into the hands of the IOTA community. This deadline passed and now it is onto you to decide about their future.\n\n**Who can vote?**\n\nAll IOTA token holders!\n\nYour voting weight will be determined by two factors:\n\n1. How many tokens do you use for this vote (100 MIOTA have 10-times more voting power than 10 MIOTA)\n2. How long do you not move your tokens during the voting period (probably about two weeks). Lower holding times will result in proportionally lower voting weight (for example, if two weeks will be defined as 100% voting weight, then holding them still for one week will result in 50% of voting weight).\n\n**!!Important!!**\n\n\u00b7 Voting is completely **for free** (no costs, no fees)\n\n\u00b7 Voting is completely **voluntary** (you will neither directly gain or lose anything by casting your vote).\n\n\u00b7 You will have **100% control of your tokens at all times** (tokens stay at your address)\n\n\u00b7 Your **tokens do not get locked** in this process (you can use them for something else at any time)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**How do I vote?**\n\nYou will be able to vote with your tokens **directly inside your official Firefly wallet** (supporting version will be released before the election, expected later this year). This version will have a completely new voting window with a clean design and a clear and easy user-interface (see mock-up pictures below as an example).\n\nIn case you vote, Firefly will send your tokens to your own address (this means they effectively don\u2019t move and they never leave your control). This transaction will carry your decision as a data-load. Your decision as well as your voting weight will be fully transparent on the IOTA Tangle. As every transaction on IOTA **your vote will be pseudonymous** (the address will be public, however your name or other personal information will never enter the network in any way).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The options: Build or Burn!**\n\n**Option A: BUILD**\n\nIf the majority of tokens votes for \u201cbuild\u201d, a decentralized form of organization (for example a DAO) will be set up by community members in order control these 60 Ti. This organization will be fully controlled by the IOTA community via token-weighted democracy or another system, that the community decides on. IOTA-focused projects that want to receive funds could be able to apply for payments according to rules that will be created and voted on by the community. Community-vote will always decide, if these funds are paid out.\n\nThis organization would be built under **democratic supervision** of the community: Important decisions will be up for vote about every 4-6 weeks within your Firefly wallet (participation is of course voluntary).\n\n**Option B: BURN**\n\nIf the majority of tokens vote to \u201cburn\u201d, no DAO will be build and instead all tokens in question will remain unmigrated into the current IOTA 1.5 (Chrysalis) network. This will irreversibly lock these tokens away, prohibiting anyone from ever using them again for any purpose.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Preliminary design of the new voting-windows in Firefly**\n\n**Vote proposal window**\n\nInside your voting menu you can see all ongoing votes regarding the IOTA treasury DAO. At the beginning you will only find the \"build or burn\" vote.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p8yrkj1uqvj71.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9e775be9582af1c640442e3d563beed66d1a5a7\n\n**Proposal details**\n\nIn the details page of any proposal you can find all important information about the vote that is to be decided on, including the exact meaning of both voting options. Here you will also find the buttons enabling you to cast your vote\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7jjcg5fvqvj71.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=29d51374659ee9624c2e65a1055a7df7e235aa0d\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Join the community efforts now!**\n\nThe IOTA treasury governance is a real grassroots development and thrives from community participation. This project needs developers, communicators as well as enthusiasts and people with ideas! Get active today by following the project or reaching out to the currently active developers on:\n\nIOTA Discord -  #governance channel\n\nWebsite: [www.iotatreasury.org](http://www.iota-treasury.org/) (under construction)\n\nI hope you enjoy the cause and for everone else: Happy voting (later this year)!",

I\u2019d like to say it\u2019s been a rollercoaster ride over this time, but it\u2019s been more like taking a road trip through Iowa where there\u2019s nothing but corn fields until suddenly Des Moines is visible in the distance for about 5 minutes, but then it\u2019s back to the corn fields and you remember that it was only Des Moines and nothing important.  Meanwhile, I\u2019ve watched these other coins such as Solana, Polkadot, Cardano, and even Ethereum shoot up exponentially in price. I try to tell myself...Tron is next, everyone is going to finally see it\u2019s greatness and to the moon we will head...but it feels like Tron is just watching everyone playing together at the park in hopes of someday having friends like that. \n\nI\u2019m still hodl\u2019ing for now. Fingers crossed that Elon Musk and his godly dictation of the market via his Twitter, accidentally reads one of Justin Sun\u2019s valiant outcries of his shout outs towards him. Or the throwing around of money towards items that could catch Elon and the rest of Reddit\u2019s eye because one of Justin\u2019s meme purchases went viral and that is all the rage at the moment. \n\nI\u2019m always contemplating if I should stay the course with Tron, or if jumping to a new ship is the route to sail. Like I said, I\u2019m hodl\u2019ing for now, but the grip is slowly being persuaded by others and is slipping away as my thoughts of what Tron should be are changing to the question of will it ever be, or is it another great prospect that didn\u2019t live up to it\u2019s potential.",

        "post_body": "I saw this Twitter post yesterday that led to a former IOTA critic describing why he became a supporter and excited about everything. It\u2018s in German and somebody asked for a translation. I liked the text so I translated it for anybody to read:\n\nGood morning!\nThere are certainly people out there wondering how I, who had always criticized IOTA turned out extremely bullish suddenly. What was the initial situation?\n\nLet me divide the IOTA situation into 5 parts:\n-IOTA Foundation (directory Board and the Team)\n-Technology\n-Communication\n-Partner/adoption\n-Community\n\nAnybody that has built businesses knows this isn\u2019t an easy task to do. I\u2019ve done so three times and I sold three times. Did everything go as planned? NO. There were days that I was happy the sleepless night was over with and I could sort out my thoughts in the morning shower.\nBuilding up a usual business may be okay but going new paths that nobody has ever taken before you, I can tell you, that\u2019s hard as hell. 80-90hrs a week may be normal. This is nothing that can be done without passion.\nThe founders of IOTA went that exact path. They had an amazing idea, a mosaic of many puzzle pieces and were full of passion. I really liked that.\nIn the beginning it was all easy-going and casual\u2026 but then it turned into aggression. They wanted to show, they\u2019re better than the rest and not let anybody criticize them \u2013 they came to win. But all of this led to running battles between the founders and Twitter etc. But why all that aggression? Well, it didn\u2019t all go smoothly \u2013 there were many technological problems. Was everything just theory? No, we all saw it and buried 2 projects. What trash\u2026 sorry! And then a chain reaction started. All of the divisions mentioned above failed. The directory board began fighting, technology failed, communication was full of empty promises and partners turned their backs. Even the community caught up on the aggression and began fighting other projects and researchers. IOTA could have easily gone straight into the ground, let\u2019s face it.\n\nObviously I was full of criticism. But something changed\n\n1. the youngest and most unexperienced of the founders kept his nerves\n2. valuable new engineers joined and brought new ideas and constructive criticism\n3. founder #1 left\n4. a community project started their own Node\n5. technology was reconsidered completely\n6. structures were rebuilt entirely\n7. founder #2 left\n\nWithin all of that there was another incident. The wallet got hacked! A very bad situation. They were just on their way and then\u2026 But it showed how strong the team really was. They fought and couldn\u2019t let this go. Obviously there was malice from outside because it was only manageable due to the system still being centralized \u2013 but it was merely luck. Point 4 followed\u2026\nI was able to emotionally recover from all of these points, but this is the past now.\nAt point 6 I knew that \u201call of it will turn out well, but let\u2019s give the project a few more months\u201d. Why? I saw a legal problem arising. It would turn the situation towards the outside. Which was a good thing. And all the other points turned out well and convincing. Let\u2019s walk through it step by step:\n\nThe IF:\nThe IF has a solid directory board. Dom does his job really well, even though I didn\u2019t think he would in the beginning. But I salute him, he ingests knowledge and applies it better every day. The wars are over with. Hands are being reached out to other projects and there are technological AND social bridges being built. Who would have thought? Of course, not many are welcoming you with open arms after never-ending fights but it seems the waves are calming.\n\nThe team:\nWhat can I say? I see true passion and excellent work on Github. Who doesn\u2019t look at it won\u2019t realize the diligence between those code lines. Often times there are plenty iterations concerning a single topic. Good isn\u2019t good enough, things are being tested again and again, reviewed, discussed, redone\u2026 in a loop. This is really really good, well, there\u2019s much at stake. And then there are extraordinary researchers \u2013 was there ever a paper that was criticized? There\u2019s a reason for it. And the composition? Apparently recruiting and finding the right people for the right jobs is done well in this remote work environment.\n\nTechnology:\nIOTA got rid of unnecessary things, that never made sense to me and partly were based on ego and justified in a weird manner. WOTS, Bundles, Ternary, IRI\u2026 They realized that the people working on other Blockchain-Projects weren\u2019t complete idiots. Other things were adopted: UTXO, Smart Contracts, Tokenization, Autopeering, Interoperability\u2026 Hallelujah, I am so thankful as now one great idea is being combined with another. And parts of the new technology are even standardized? WOW!\nAdditionally, the community project surrounding Muxxer was producing a hell of a Node. Cannot compare to before. Finally a node that simply works and does its job. But that wasn\u2019t all of it\u2026\nStrategically clever, there will be Bee Node to prevent SpoF (single point of failure). Great!\nStill not all of it\u2026 \nThere already is a network that runs completely without the Coordinator: Pollen! How cool is that? Yes, it\u2019s still a testnet, but it shows that obviously all of those ideas are actually realizable. Is that really the case? The research team delivers one result after the next. Everything points to any idea being mathematically possible. Cardano is being praised for their scientific approach \u2013 IOTA won\u2019t be any less than that in the end.\n\nCommunity:\nWhat a crazy bunch\u2026 in a positive way. And what a change, as well. Just today a user on twitter was saying: \u201cMaybe it\u2019s because every other Tweet from the IOTA community starts with: BTC is a catastrophy for the environment, ETH fees are too high, the Tangle is better than Blockchain, etc\u2026\u201d\nThose comparisons are, thankfully, getting less and less, which is a good thing. It won\u2019t be thousands of protocols surviving but I can envision around 10 protocols to work together in the future. The community is on its way and learned their lesson. They are beginning to rather share the positive news. I really like to see this and will contribute to others perceiving us in a positive light.\n\nPartner/adoption:\nThis is the hardest part, because Chrysalis Pt. 2 is not live yet. Though even today we see new partners or great projects with reputable companies like CityxChange, EDAG, etc\u2026 This is not a \u201cwe could\u2026\u201d, no, these are projects that are currently live. They\u2019re live because the nodes are live and transactions flow. They\u2019re live because of standards. Do you realize? All parts of IOTA are shifting to positivity and success. Isn\u2019t that amazing?\n\nAt this time, I am incredibly convinced that IOTA is on the right track, and it isn\u2019t too late. An amazing piece of technology is being developed. Yes, it makes me bullish\u2026 extremely bullish!!!\n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/vrom14286662/status/1360301229432184832?s=21)",

        "post_title": "Time For A Paradigm Shift Has Come",
        "post_body": "This post was triggered by convos on Twitter I had had with some IT specialists. I was surprised to know that people who were supposed to be on the very edge of the progress and critically rethink old paradigms preferred to avoid thinking out of the box. For some reason this self-censoring reminded me \u201c1984\u201d by Orwell. I don\u2019t know what causes this phenomenon but I lean towards accepting Richard Dawkins\u2019 hypothesis (from his \u201cThe God Delusion\u201d) explaining why a lot of people believe in gods (and in undoubted authority of some mere mortals). I won\u2019t spoil the details with my TLDR version, the book is worth to be read by every person who considers themselves open-minded.\n\nTwo decades ago when I was starting my professional work in IT I was studying in the leading university of Belarus (Belarusian State University). I had to choose the specialization and Cryptography and Artificial Intelligence were equally attractive. In the end I picked AI but was studying Cryptography on my own. I recall being reading an article where the author was claiming that a cryptographic algorithm with such high complexity that it can\u2019t \u201cfit\u201d into a human brain would never be broken because noone would be able to analyze it. There was another article lying on my table where another author was claiming that while the human brain couldn\u2019t comprehend very complex things it could create AI capable to do that. Many years later these articles mixed together into an idea which I want to share with you.\n\nBefore that we\u2019ll do another excurse into the past though. During some period of time cryptographers believed that weak ciphers could be strengthened by just increasing the number of rounds. In 1999 Alex Biryukov and David Wagner presented the slide attack which proved them wrong. Cryptographers tried to counteract the attack by making the rounds differ but such improvements to the attack as \u201cComplementation slide\u201d and \u201cSliding with a twist\u201d (https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F3-540-45539-6_41.pdf) demonstrated that making an algorithm more complex is not a very good solution (if a solution at all). Now the cryptographers still use different round functions (e.g. different round constants in Keccak), but I\u2019m sure that this won\u2019t save them once AI progress sets new records.\n\nAI-assisted cryptanalysis is already being used, for an example of that refer to \u201cAttack and Construction of Simulator for Some of Cipher Systems Using Neuro-Identifier\u201d by Khaled Alallayah et al. (http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=8B251C70BBA7E94D06E1F5BDE0DA6A44?doi=10.1.1.178.3467&rep=rep1&type=pdf). Advancements in AI make me think that we\u2019ll see popular cryptoprimitives being broken by an AI within next 5-10 years. Wide access to AI-oriented hardware like https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrueNorth will definitely help this happen earlier. What can we do to reduce the threat of AI attacks on cryptographic algorithms? The only answer I see: we should use so transparent algorithms that an AI couldn\u2019t exploit its advantage of being much smarter.\n\nImagine a pond with fish. The pond is our algorithm, the fish is vulnerabilities. Catching fish would mean breaking the algorithm via vulnerabilities. Murky water wouldn\u2019t allow seeing if there is any fish, clear water would, this is why we need the transparency. The core of my idea: create algorithms which are as transparent/simple as possible, if then you don\u2019t see vulnerabilities then odds that an AI won\u2019t see them too are much higher than if you created something obscure/complex. By following the advice you will also get a cryptoprimitive which is easier to analyze thus reducing the time between the creation and the deployment to production. I\u2019ll emphasize it again, the algorithm should be as simple as possible. This should be a mandatory design goal, because without it, even if the most respected cryptographers found no vulnerabilities after decades of analyses we can\u2019t be sure that the algorithm is secure. This claim is based on my slightly paradoxical belief that for the human brain it\u2019s possible to create an AI which could do things impossible for its creator.\n\nCurl-P was created by following the idea of simplicity. While de-jure I can say that it was me who created Curl-P, de-facto it was created by a primitive AI created by me. That wasn\u2019t AI of general purpose; an improved version of the AI is working on the final version of Curl now while I\u2019m writing this post. This situation is quite funny because it look unusual, interesting if in the future we\u2019ll see cases similar to https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/06/monkey-selfie-case-animal-photo-copyright but with an AI instead of an animal. By the way, there are a lot of attempts to create a lightweight hashing function, I\u2019d be grateful if someone confirmed or refuted my observation that Curl-P is winning this competition.\n\nIOTA was created to be immune to quantum computer attacks, today I have revealed that it was also created to be immune to attacks from an AI. IOTA was the very first distributed ledger technology to consider imminent threat from technologies which look exotic now. NSA already validated our prediction regarding quantum computers. I think that the both threats (QC and AI) have equal chances to become real in the near future and I\u2019m confident that in few years we\u2019ll see confirmations that the prediction about AI was prophetic too. If someone hasn\u2019t got it yet \u2013 IOTA is about the future and it relies only on those paradigms which pass the test of critical thinking.",

If 2 mining pools can just point and say, \u201cthis way\u201d then that doesn\u2019t speak volumes for decentralisation (although I don\u2019t know if this is the case). My point being that BCH hasn\u2019t encountered this flawless journey towards its current network status, and I believe that a truly decentralised solution (in its final working state) either shouldn\u2019t require major changes from a majority shareholder, or there should exist a method to vote on major changes (similar to Cardano). The issue I find with BCH it\u2019s still an altered version of a Bitcoin Core, and while adjusting the block size is currently a viable solution, the increase in the barrier to entry in terms of running a node/mining doesn\u2019t sit well with me. Personally, I\u2019m not rooting for Bitcoin Cash as a P2P solution, and the massive split in the community back in 2017 left a bad first impression in my mind. Correct me if any of this is off."

[This is the resulting thread](https://np.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/8njqm1/can_anyone_break_this_down_dash_private_send_vs/)\n\nI am going to reply to [**this comment**](https://np.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/8njqm1/can_anyone_break_this_down_dash_private_send_vs/dzw56nj/) in particluar and will debunk it almost word for word ([backup copy here](https://i.imgur.com/chaOsYL.png)). When I read it the first time it felt like the amount of falsehoods in it exceeded the amount of words used. That's why I decided to dedicate a thread to it. \n\nPlease note that I have posted a large collection of refutations, corrections and debunkings from other authors and myself [in the local wiki](https://old.reddit.com/r/dashpay/wiki/index#wiki_addendum.3A_misconceptions_on_dash_cleared_up) so if you're confronted with other lies, chances are good you'll find something useful in there, as trolls aren't very creative and regurgitate long debunked nonsense 99% of the time.\n\nAlright, enough of that, let's get to the meat of it:\n\nI am assuming you have read the full comment or have it in front of you.\n\n## The Debunking\n\n>Dash private send is basically a stupid mixing service\n\nNot nearly as stupid as obfuscating an entire blockchain [turning its encryption into a centralized point of failure.](https://steemit.com/cryptonote/@macrochip/warning-every-cryptonote-monero-transaction-in-history-will-be-retroactively-exposed)\n\n>that takes hours,\n\n*May* take hours. PrivateSend mixing speeds have been **significantly** improved in v12.1 and v12.2. Depending on the amount you want to mix you can get it done in less than one.\n\n>then supposedly gives you \"clean\" coins,\n\nNothing \"supposedly\" about it. They *are* clean coins. No one has proven it to be otherwise. [Can't say the same about Monero.](https://www.reddit.com/r/dashpay/comments/65fz68/dashs_privacy_feature_has_never_been_broken_turns/)\n\n>but as soon as you spend them you need to redo the whole thing again (to unlink your coins again)\n\n100% false and embarrassingly so due to fundamental ignorance on how PrivateSend works. You **don't** need to \"redo the whole thing again\". After mixing you have another balance known as the PrivateSend balance in your wallet. You can spend from that until it's depleted. Theoretically you could mix your entire Dash wealth (which you'd do only **once**) and spend it over the course of your life without having to mix ever again.\n\n>You need to trust a handful of masternodes and their providers\n\nAgain false. Double-false even: \n\n1. 4700 is not \"a handful\" of Masternodes. Moreover it's more than 3 times the nodes Monero has, so trying to belittle one of the strongest full node infrastructures in the entire crypto-space is quite pathetic.\n2. You don't need to trust anyone. The process is randomized and done over several rounds and over several Masternodes. **Trustlessness is an emerging property of decentralization** and Masternodes are exactly that [since they're spread across many countries and many providers.](https://np.reddit.com/r/dashpay/comments/7hhzcn/what_makes_dash_special/dqrrxu2/) \n\n>for that cumbersome anonymity.\n\nNot nearly as cumbersome as Monero's privacy with oversized transactions, [complete unscalability](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/5sd6rx/sidestepping_the_block_size_debate_for_a_second/dde78jp/), lack of solid infrastructure and [a blockchain so big](https://i.imgur.com/Knx4SRq.png) that nobody wants to run a sync for a full node, so the majority of users are forced to use [a centralized web-wallet service](https://mymonero.com/#/) where the admin, fluffypony, can see everyone's transactions. How's that for cumbersome? More like downright dangerous if you ask me. \n\nContrast that to: Mix once in your own ultra-fast syncing wallet, spend & confirm instantly. So \"cumbersome\"!\n\n>As there are not enough people using the feature to mix with you\n\nAgain false. Mixing times have improved significantly thanks to multisession-mixing since 12.1 and [an increasing amount of daily mixing transactions.](https://dashradar.com/charts/mixing-transactions-per-day)\n\n>there are so called liquidity providers, \n\nThere haven't been liquidity providers in Dash for at least a year, probably much longer.\n\n>that you need to trust as well.\n\n100% false and again ignorance on how PrivateSend works. A mixing party has zero insight on who they are mixing with/who the other parties are and even if they did: all information would be worthless with the next round of mixing, since they have no control over who they mix with. The network decides that randomly and unpredictably thanks to the entropy Proof of Work is providing us. But again: There are no liquidity providers anymore as independent mixing has been working well enough for quite a while now.\n\n>Unless you keep your wallets separate (exactly as with Bitcoin) anyone receiving funds from you can find out how much you own. \n\nThis is so false it makes your head spin. The PrivateSend balance in your wallet consists of hundreds, sometimes thousands of mixed inputs sitting each on newly generated addresses split into PrivateSend denominations that are indistinguishable from any other person's cloud of denominations. If you send someone a certain amount from your balance the wallet takes the appropriate denominations and \"stitches together\" the amount you wanna send. The recipient receives a load of identical inputs **with no earthly way of knowing** which wallet these coins originated from. You don't have to keep anything separate as your wallet does that for you anyway. Why wouldn't it?! Btw: PrivateSend is going to be supported by Dash mobile wallets as well.\n\n>Without even diving in the technicalities\n\nI guess you should have. I did (a little) and I have shown that Monero cannot scale and is deeply vulnerable in its privacy scheme. The fact that a fork of the project is enough to have users expose themselves should make any privacy minded person shudder.\n\n>anyone just using it once and being private from the get go\n\nBy \"get go\" you mean after waiting a week or two until the local client synced by downloading the oversized blockchain from 1500 Raspberry Pis or the moment you've created an account at MyMonero.com where at least one person knows your account balance and your tx history?\n\n>without hassle\n\nStill syncing, please stand by...\n\n>without standing out\n\nUntil the entire blockchain is exposed by cracking its single layer of encryption.\n\n>will immediately grasp what fungibility means and will have a hard time going back to any weak Bitcoin+whatever_crap_layer like Dash is.\n\nTalking about \"crap layer\" yet we have your very own Riccardo Spagni talk about how he wants to co-opt Dash's genius like so many other copycoins have already done, [**after finally admitting that you can't compete with Dash's Treasury system and thus its secondary layer.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=6189&v=oZVBS4-h-sE)\n\n## Questions to the general reader\n\n* Notice how this lie-ridden post is the top comment in that thread?\n* Notice how it doesn't even address the points raised by the comment OP quoted?\n* Notice how nobody from the Dash community ever spouted such flagrant lies about Monero? Or any other coin for that matter?\n* It gets better: Notice how that person carries the flair **\"XMR Core Team\"**? How many Dash Core Team members are spreading lies about other projects?\n* And finally: How much more evidence do you need that Monero is a toxic troll community **literally** *to its Core*? It's not just the comment itself proving it, but the amount of approval it receives.\n\nSo I challenge anyone who claims \"Dash isn't any better\" to demonstrate this sort of behaviour within this community.\n\nI end this thread with [one of my favorite quotes](https://i.imgur.com/19ZXgpS.png)",

        "post_body": "One case people make against XRP is that banks aren't adopting xrp, but rather xcurrent. Here are two analogies that will make you understand:\n\nCars first came out in the late 1800s. Cars (digital assets / xrapid). were by far faster and more efficient than their imediate predecessor, horse pulled carriages (swift). However, for people to truly start adopting cars in the masses a system had to be laid down first, the highway network of the 1950s (xcurrent). At some point, banks will be foolish to keep using their horse drawn carriages while other banks are beating them with much faster cars. At the same time, banks wouldn't start to adopt the car until a solid network (xcurrent) is in place. Just like many were likely skeptical to go drive the first cars out on the old dirt roads, banks are right now skeptical to go out and use digital assets in the framework of the old system. With xcurrent, ripple is right now laying down the framework (the highway) for banks to start using digital currencies. A point will come though where banks will have to also adopt xrp (the cars) for the same reason it would be foolish to go out in a horse drawn carriage on a highway. Ripple's huge advantage over other digital assets is that they are making the highway system and so they also have the control over which car (digital asset) banks must choose, xrp.\n\nSecond analogy. Napster came out in 1999. Similar to most digital assets, it was a very decentralized network that the established industry, in this case the record industry, did not like. Napster perhaps had grandiose visions of liberalizing music and large music companies falling down. At the same time, there wasn't instant adoption of MP3s by the record industry, although MP3s had many advantages over CDs. Apple came along, and became a bridge between these two extremes. With its apple store (xcurrent we could perhaps say), Apple was able to get a lot of established music companies to release their songs in MP3 format. This then led to many in the public purchasing apple mp3 products (which we could think of like xrp). For us, xrp is the product that will bring profit, but xrp adoption will not happen without a bridge. Likewise, many digital assets out there will not be adopted by established players because, as in the case of Napster, there is no bridge between the two extremes. Once this bridge is established, it is a natural result that the company's main product (mp3 hardware, smart phones, xrp) can profit from it.\n\nIt is not a matter of if XRP will be used, it is a matter of when.",

Soon you will be able to enjoy Electroneum\u2019s new App.\n\n[President & Ceo Richards Ells](https://reddit.com/link/8x2eim/video/mgwntfd2gq811/player)\n\nRight now, with this amount of news and developments (and even more massive announcements to come), the 1 question you must ask yourself is not whether this coin will fly; rather, you must only ask yourself how high?\n\n[https://twitter.com/coinbene/status/1014850882477817857](https://twitter.com/coinbene/status/1014850882477817857)\n\nCoinBene is a Singapore-based exchange with approximately $2.0 billion of trading volume, according to Coinmarketcap. Just to give you an idea how massive this is, here are some stats on the exchanges: CoinBene sits in the top position with about $2.0 billion of trading volume, Bit-Z meanwhile holds down second place with $1.25 billion of volume, and OKEx is in third place with approximately $913 million. Binance, meanwhile, is a distant fourth with a trading volume of $602 million, followed by Huobi, Bitfinex, ZB, Bibox, HitBTC, and Upbit in the top 10.\n\nIn the 2-minute exclusive above with Electroneum President and CEO Richard Ells, he describes his vision and a plan with **2 and 5 year goals**. In order to achieve these goals changes needed to be made to the blockchain to accommodate the massive flood of new ETN users that will soon be coming (ETN already is on the heels of 2.0 Million users and is on course to pass this milestone any day now\u2026). It was a must and absolute necessity to introduce the ASICS back into the platform.\n\nBy having a dedicated ASIC mining base (as opposed to miners who can switch at will) provides significantly more security. Blockchain communities should embrace ASIC development on their networks rather than resist it. Many developers in the cryptocurrency world say that the fears of centralization are overblown and that ASICs actually improve the security of a cryptocurrency network by making them harder to dominate with raw computing power.\n\nWith large GPU-based mining operations there is a lot of jumping from coin to coin and mining the most profitable coin.  ETN was abused by them for much too long. For smaller networks in particular, like ETN at the moment, high volatility in hash rate (caused by large scale miners \u201cjumping\u201d between coins) did pose a threat as it could lead to less stability and security, thus increasing vulnerability. This was certainly a factor why Electroneum had to take these actions (and indeed some of the best and most swiftly executed actions I have seen so far). Big exchanges are looking for stable coins with no drama. I am happy to see CoinBene listing ETN, and they will need a stable block chain like the one we now have to sustain the power of a big exchange.\n\nIt was not a matter if, but when, someone would come along with enough rented hash power and raid the network for 51&#37;. Can I tell you, had that happened you would see the same group of people pointing their fingers that the dev team is doing a crappy job and why they did not stop it. Well guess what: ETN has stopped the monster everyone was afraid of. This was a BRILLIANT move and no one had seen it coming -- JOB WELL DONE ETN! Keep it up \u2013 in no time you will become the coin that everyone is forced to reckon with.\n\n**Consider this:** 20 Million ETN users (and quite possibly more). If each only has just 1,000 ETN that is the entire circulating supply. \u2026and there are many, many, many users who hold millions of ETN.  There will come a day when we are talking about ETN in dollars, not cents. Yes, dollars. And now you see why.\n\n[The coin that will change the world](https://preview.redd.it/1r3idlychq811.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eccefbbb2d6bcf85a498c7bb14c2e05ed7e7f094)\n\n**Bonus:**\n\nHere is a little something extra for the entire Electroneum community including those who disagree, gave up or lost faith in this coin/project, it is not too late to get back in the game you know! To all of the die hard fans and supporters out there, youtubers, ETN Telegram Channels KQ, The Army, Knights, ETN Main, ETN Business, ETN Price, Discords and Reddit Channels/Teams. To all the admins keeping the peace on reddit and telegram moderating the content and putting up with a lot of nonsense and assisting the ones who needed their help. To all and any individuals that had contributed in any way what so ever directly or indirectly, if you are sitting on the sidelines and want to get involved **join us** we are looking forward to working with you. Special Thanks to the Electroneum Media and Dev Teams who worked through all the fud,  hate, manipulation and the name calling. Finally, to the ETN Executive Team  Mr. Ells & Mr. Gorman for slaving 100+ hours a week and delivering on their promises.  Thank you all for a Job Well Done or as we like to say: Bravo Zulu (BZ)! The short video below was made just for you. Enjoy!\n\n[Fud Eater](https://reddit.com/link/8x2eim/video/c61vhznwer811/player)\n\n[**Electroneum (ETN): Unstoppable If We Work As A Team.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Electroneum/comments/8srm0y/electroneum_etn_unstoppable_if_we_work_as_a_team/)\n\nTo be continued\u2026",

        "post_body": "It would seem that most of Joe Public have little to no interest in Dash and many who were previously big Dash advocates have seen light in other projects, spread their wings and flown from the Dash nest.\n\nPop over to other projects subreddits or twitter pages and you'll see more posts, more comments, more followers and more likes - MORE INTEREST - for the projects I mention below\n\nJust for comparison, the Monero subreddit has nearly 200k followers, Cardano over 110k followers.  Dash subreddit has 36k followers and that has hardly grown in 3 years, yet Dash launched before either of these.\n\nSo, why is it that projects like Cardano, Litecoin, XRP, Ethereum and even to some degree Monero (which has probably had some of the biggest hurdles of any project, certainly from a regulatory standpoint) have been able to maintain and grow user interest in their project while Dash has stagnated in followers and dwindled in marketcap and seemingly cannot attract new interest among regular folk?\n\nIt has been quite obvious for the past few years that Dash is quite often on the wrong side compared to the other projects, I mentioned above, when the whole market takes a turn - Dash usually has less gains and greater losses comparatively and slides further down the ranks while these other projects have been able to maintain their positions for the most part and most importantly their visibility in the top 10 or 20 of market cap while Dash is as of today outside the top 40 - that's truly shocking for a project supposedly making so much ground.\n\nThis isn't just about price though.  It's about a serious lack of excitement from outside this community even when Dash continues to make positive technical or commercial strides.\n\nEdit:. The things that got people from outside the community excited or interested in Dash historically were its privacy - which the Dash Core CEO keeps distancing Dash from. The introduction of interest bearing accounts for anyone who holds Dash long enough; which would garner huge interest for those not already advocates of Dash and finally the ability for non-masternode owners being able to stake a smaller amount to have a say on the decisions the network takes in the same way (or similar) as masternode owners do.  Dash as it stands is offering little financial incentive or an incentive to be part of the community (i.e. allowing a real say in its direction) for people to risk their money to want to hold or buy it.  The only people championing Dash, as far as I can see, are masternode owners, Dash core and some 3rd party businesses.",

        "post_body": "On June 26th the Tron Network will hold its first ever elections for \"Super Delegates\" on the Tron Network. These 27 elected delegates will generate blocks for the entire network. In addition they will hold voting seats in the network itself to determine the ultimate direction of Tron and TRX. \n\n\n Earning a seat is an enormous task, as it requires that you meet the qualifications set by Tron, house equipment with the ability to generate blocks (process transactions on the network) and be voted in the by the community. \n\nYou will be able to cast one vote for each TRX held  ( 100 TRX = 100 votes )\n\n\n A majority of those applying for Seats today are Cryptocurrencies or Large Investment groups, which can secure a vote through their own finances, purchasing sufficient TRX to earn a seat . We cannot, instead we will be actively campaigning for a seat. \n\n\n We will be acting under the name \u201csesameseed\u201d\n\n\n SesameSeed is unique in that this is a not for profit organization, despite the fact that these seats will generate 37,376,000 TRX per year, 100% of profits from this seat will be distributed equally to our supporters (in proportion to votes cast). Simply becoming a member and voting for us will earn TRX if we are elected. \n\nYou can find more information on our website \n\nwww.sesameseed.org\n\n This is our Telegram link\n\n\nhttps://t.me/sesame_seed_community\n\n\nHere is our twitter link\n\nhttps://twitter.com/sesameseed_SR\n\n\nF.A.Q.\n\nQ:  Does it cost anything to vote?                                                                                              \n A:  Voting is free. You only need to hold TRX in your wallet to vote. One vote for each TRX you hold.\n\nQ: Why should I join the Sesameseed collective?\nA: Super Representatives are allowed to vote for themselves. Large companies and hedge funds are running for seats and can simply buy their way in by holding large amounts of TRX. By organizing as a collective we can decentralize these seats and directly take part in the Tron network. Sesameseed gives the community a voice in governance of the network and a way to generate revenue from their investment.\n\nQ: How will the community govern the Super Representative Seat? \nA: Through Monthly Voting, Ideas proposed through our social medial channels will filter down into positions, ideals and use of funds for the collective. The community at a 1 vote per member will vote these on once per month. Any member that has participated in voting during that month will be able to vote in this process.\n\nQ: How will Sesameseed distribute the rewards to the voters? The actual distribution mechanism, the frequency of the payouts, the percentage paid based on number of votes etc.? \nA: We will be issuing a token that is 1:1 convertible to TRX. You will be able to accrue these and exchange them at any time. Frequency of Payouts will be weekly, with a percentage based on total votes cast. This does mean that we will require members to register and provide deposit addresses on our website. \n\nQ: if 80 % goes to voters, 10% to maintenance and 10% to be voted on, where does sesameseed profit?\nA: The seat won\u2019t generate revenue. There is no profit here. This is a community, that\u2019s it really, a seat that can help direct the Tron network in the future by consensus. This will be made transparent through the distributed ledger, as all transactions will be completely transparent\n\nQ: What do I do now? A: Tron has not yet detailed the method of voting; When they announce these details publicly we will provide the update and necessary information to our community. At this time It is best to subscribe to our Telegram and Mailing list found on our website. A formal Registration process will commence in Mid May.\n\nJoin us On Telegram:  https://t.me/sesame_seed_community\nJoin our Mailing List: https://www.sesameseed.org\n\nQ: How much of a reward will I receive for voting? A: 10% of rewards will be reserved for basic administrative costs, largely server operation, the details of which will be shared publicly; all remaining funds will be distributed to the community. 10% of rewards will be held in reserve; the support community will vote upon their use monthly. The remaining 80% will be distributed back to the community in proportion to votes cast.\n\nQ: How many elections will be held? A: The Tron team has not finalized the frequency of elections, but we can expect a up to every 24 hours.\n\nQ: Can I earn TRX at every election? \nA: YES!  Every vote at every election will go into the reward pool.\n",

But, lets say Bitcoin had never been castrated as it has been and there were no significant forks such as BCH, BSV etc. As great as it is for having proved Byzantine fault tolerance (automated trust) is possible, it would still be obsolete today. Bitcoin did an amazing thing in proving BFT is possible, but in the decade since then we now know how to deliver BFT in a completely different manner, with \ndeterministic transaction finality (100% final), \nunbounded scalability with performance that improves as the network gets busy, \nextremely low energy use (green tech matters),\n no middlemen gatekeeping access to the ledger (Roger Ver should have won that bet he made about low fees but his transaction was deliberately cherry picked by the miner and taken out of sequence), \nLow, fixed fees; no matter how busy the network,\nsmart contracts and on-chain code,\nDeFi ,\nSelf Sovereign,\nCustom Tokens and Stable coins.\nAll from the wallet.\nhttps://ostable.org/?r=LTXRMGCRZIQIIMOYFVC4ZGI5AJOSVWXN"

        "post_body": "First of all, before I list this information, I'm a bit taken back by how insulting some are on here. He's doing his damn best to explain things in English to everyone, and people are just insulting his attempt to do so. Also the fact that he's not just saying buzzwords... he's doing his best to be super forward facing to his backers. You can hear that he's genuine in his inflections.\n\nAlso, this is a very informal, Periscope stream. If anyone actually thought he'd have a Powerpoint or shit like that to be seen, you all greatly misunderstood what his plan was for tonight.\n\n**For anyone who wants to read the disorganized transcript of the Livestream, courtiously done by btcrazy as fast as he could, you can find that post here: [ROUGH TRANSCRIPT](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tronix/comments/7ogk2z/rough_transcription_of_the_livestream/)**\n\n\n\n**GENERAL**\n\n* Stream is dedicated to the Vision of Tron, his background, and Investors Backgrounds.\n\n**PERSONAL**\n\n* He is considering turning over control of PeiWo and moving to SanFrancisco to fully devote his time to Tron as he has the confidence they can handle PeiWo from where they are at.\n\n**PARTNERSHIPS**\n\n* Partnerships with a large social facing company such as Facebook, Tenecent (WeChat), etc clearly won't be the partner announcement, as he spent a decent amount of time talking about how he doesn't like the way they treat the users.\n* [Bitmain](https://www.bitmain.com/) Partnership - Largest Bitcoin Miner Company in China\n* [oBike](https://www.o.bike/) Partnership\n* [Gifto](https://gifto.io/) Partnership - He's on their Board of Directors and the company was Created by the founders of Up.Live. Gifto will be releasing a new coin on their network (believed to be Tron right now) (More information about Gifto [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tronix/comments/7ogj31/takeaways_from_justins_livestream/ds9dk48/))\n\n**TRON PLATFORM**\n\n* Decentralized internet platform that stops all the data aggregation and rewards the content creators instead of the companies that host the platform itself.\n* Your private key will be your Login to all TRX Apps, ultimately allowing your accounts to be as secure as your current crypto investments.\n\n**TRON PIPELINE**\n\n* Hired 10 people last week on the application integration\n* At least 5 NASDAQ Public listed companies are partnered with them, but due to their own discretion, will be annouced at a later time by both parties.\n* With these major new partnerships, these need to be finalized and that takes time, so everyone should be patient while these announcements roll out\n\n**TRON DOGS**\n\n* Year of the Puppy(Dog) hence the point of making the initial launch of pets focused on TRON Dogs. The game is still being fleshed out with many other features.\n\n**TEAM MEMBERS**\n\n* I won't lie, I understood the function of the people he was talking about, and they have great backgrounds, but I won't make a half-assed attempt to write their names here. If anyone can speak about this, the information was definitely present in the stream.\n* People from Microsoft, Alibaba, JD and PKU have joined the team. If anyone can list these names and what he said their part is in this below, I will gladly add to the post.\n\n**TRON GIVEAWAY**\n\n* 5 Individuals who re-tweeted during the stream will be awarded 80 TRON, which was set by their marketing beforehand. He hopes by next stream to greatly increase this amount.\n\n\n\n**LASTLY, Periscope crashed, so he is having an AMA to the best of his abilites here:**\nhttps://twitter.com/justinsuntron/status/949475975229685760\n\n*[Permalink](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tronix/comments/7ogj31/takeaways_from_justins_livestream/ds9fp7m/) about my Wife who speaks Mandarin watching his Mandarin stream.*  \n\n\n*There will be rolling edits to this post as more accurate information that was missed is collected.*  \n\n*[LINK](https://weibo.com/tv/l/JFSzPy7319YnH2QW) - This is his stream in Mandarin incase anyone wants to see.*",

I see time that needs to go in to parts of this project, but not being able to draw enough developers due to funding. Let's be honest, hardly anyone is going to invest time and resources into a project without having any kind of economic incentive. Some will, but it will be here and there when they have time. We all do things we would rather not do to make money, so that we can pay our bills, eat food, have a home, etc. These are needs for survival. This is the only thing that worries me with community driven coins. Don't get me wrong, love the idea, but the survival has a lot of hurdles to get over. \n\nMy solution:\n\nGhandi said, \"Be the change you want to see in the world.\" So I am putting my ideals where my money is. I am contemplating donating \"a percentage\" of all the BTCP I get from this fork to the development of BTCP. \n\nI left \"a percentage\" in there because I have not fully decided on an amount. This decision will be based off of community interest, involvement. I'm not going to be the guy pumping money in to it to only see it dump and go stagnant like ZClassic did after a while. I want this to survive and thrive. And I am willing to provide funding to motivated developers. To my knowledge, the devs already have a donation fund set up, so that won't be a problem.  \n\nPlease, share your thoughts. This is something I am considering, so if you think this is an idea that can work, please share, respond, tweet, whatever. The community needs to see how strong we are united.\n\nThank you in advance.     \n\n  ",

        "post_body": "Welcome to Forward Thinking Friday, a regular venue to discuss ideas, concepts and designs that push Decred further, bigger and better. Topics raised can be anything ranging from:\n\n* Technological improvements or enhancements\n* Unique opportunities well serviced by the Decred protocol\n* Responses to competing protocol designs and features\n* Integrations and Infrastructure\n* Marketing and Project Messaging\n\n[Artist: https:\\/\\/twitter.com\\/aithzakaria1\\/status\\/1327390282879537153](https://preview.redd.it/yloor1cea5z51.png?width=786&format=png&auto=webp&s=ea369e2db7af3dc1e17904ddc4fb3f12281d09b4)\n\n# Where the DCR Price trolls at now?\n\nThey are still lurking but are waiting for a damn pullback in the price chart. Good luck with that.\n\nThe social momentum has been literally off the charts. Decred has shown up in more [Big Green Dildo](https://twitter.com/_Checkmatey_/status/1327147539674632192)s,  [social momentum](https://twitter.com/CoinTrendz/status/1327159280827576322) and [top gainer charts](https://twitter.com/_Checkmatey_/status/1325170810311503879) in the past two weeks than almost any other coin during this bounce.\n\nThe market is starting to get it and the DEX is pulling absolute rank keeping the buy walls advancing. Just to prove that this is not a crock of absolute shit, check out the 28-day growth in engagement with my shitposting. Only Decred's price chart compares with these stats.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mjhywop3b5z51.png?width=972&format=png&auto=webp&s=54b73634f908b2ba43461285fac8f177e39022d7\n\nI think everyone notices that market bottoms are a psychological event, not necessarily all technical price event. The bottom of stakeholder and DCR speculator fear, despair and sadness is in, and a new age of confidence and resilience takes its place. This much is becoming clearer in the charts, data and social momentum.\n\n# A new narrative: Price is Decred's Strength\n\nYou have hands of steel and weathered the worst bear market on record. Now is the time we re-write the history books as the victor and make Price Decred's strength. From watching my social engagement over the past months, the narrative and shitposts which gathered maximum momentum and engagement (BY FAR!) ...you guessed it, focused on price.\n\nThe winning narrative so far is **Decred is being Repriced**. This harks back to Murad's Decred in Depth podcast where he states that money is not valued, it is priced. DCR being repriced higher than its lesser equipped challengers LTC/BCH/XRP is resonating. It provides a VERY tangible price objective and the more someone hears it, the more they believe it. Coupled with on-chain and technical analysis levels, any pleb understands Number go Up and when it breaks a ceiling, it compounds confidence and creates a buy level for pullbacks.\n\nData covering exchange volume on the DEX and privacy mixing etc is proof of the pudding is a clear second place for engagement. People love to share soundbites of reality to justify and generally win a contest or debate.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ejtao48zc5z51.png?width=573&format=png&auto=webp&s=149db2bdceb8978e9fab2db7c2f40b670f58cedb\n\nThe snowball is rolling down the hill folks and the thing is wearing a Decred T-shirt.\n\nWell done, keep it up and prepare for the avalanche.",

Currently there are plenty reasons why this could be the case. The most likely ones: Wallet not synced (see sync speedup FAQ), corrupted DB (try rebuilding index via wallet menu), firewall prevents sync (grant wallet access in windows firewall). Try to re-install the client or switch to another wallet (e.g. NEO web or OTCGO web). A more user-friendly light weighted wallet is on the way (CoZ Electron Wallet).

I logged in and checked for her a few times in the first few months but then I got tired of it.  I told her the risks of forgetting her pw or losing her phone and 2fa with it, I asked about transferring it to a paper wallet and she wasn't interested.\n\nSome people just aren't into crypto.  They have enough interest and money to buy crypto, but they really don't want crypto.  Many of these people will lose their EOS and not care.

        "post_body": "&#x200B;\n\n[Pic source: www.jmmnews.com\\/the-dark-side-of-the-internet-of-things\\/](https://preview.redd.it/9wz3ox5ygsx71.png?width=1140&format=png&auto=webp&s=053bdf5542814255c459f01c2f22803e95170b04)\n\nHave you ever wondered what the actual use of the IOTA token is within a feeless network? Well, you are not alone. One of the most frequent questions regarding the IOTA protocol always was how adoption by governments and industry will translate into demand for IOTA token and therefore into rising prices. And even though good arguments could be made that IOTA tokens would have been used for smart contracts and payments, the now released update plans lift IOTA tokenomics to a completely different level.\n\n**The IOTA Foundations plans two distinct updates:**\n\n1. **Tokenization framework** will introduce a multitude of new functionalities\n2. **Dust protection** will tie almost every use of the IOTA network to the IOTA token \u2013 while still remaining feeless.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Let\u00b4s start with IOTAs new functionalities**\n\n**SimpleOutputs**\n\nOK this one is actually not new, but let\u00b4s have a quick look at it in order to later understand how dust protection improves IOTA tokenomics. A SimpleOutput is a \u201cnormal token transaction\u201d. More precicely, it is an unspend transaction output (UTXO), that holds IOTA tokens.\n\n**ExtendedOutputs:**\n\nNow we come to the juicy part. ExtendedOutputs will vastly extend the functionality of the IOTA network. It will transform from a single-asset ledger without NFTs or smart contracts to a literal multi-asset multiverse and utility-beast. Let\u00b4s have a look at the new output types.\n\n**Token foundries**\n\nA token foundry output is a transaction (UTXO) that can **print new tokens out of thin air**. Any user can very cheaply print a basically infinite amount of user-defined tokens, so called native-tokens, directly on the IOTA mainnet. These can be used to represent currencies, like Euro, Dollar or Bitcoin, fractional ownership over houses or cars, stocks, meme-coins or anything else that the founding entity wants them to represent. All these new tokens can freely move on the IOTA mainnet **in parallel** to the original IOTA tokens.\n\nIf you wonder how this can improve demand for IOTA tokens, wait until you see the dust protection mechanism later in this post. It will be eye-opening.\n\n**Aliases**\n\nAlias output types allow smart contracts to interact with the Tangle. They will be able to act as entities on the network, send and receive any kind of output and can therefore, for example, create wrapped tokens (via foundry outputs) or NFTs. Aliases are so integral for the use of smart contracts, that the tokenization update will most likely happen at the same time as the IOTA smart contract protocol (ISCP) update on the mainnet.\n\n**NFTs**\n\nNon-fungible tokens (NFTs) are unique tokens that cannot be reproduced in any way. They usually hold specific data in order to represent things that only exist one single time, like collectibles, art, trophies or badges. Just like the native tokens from foundry outputs, NFTs can be created out of thin air. They can carry any kind of meta-data, for example a link to a picture (like most popular art NFTs). A unique identifier and a cryptographic signature by the issuer ensure their uniqueness in the data-base.\n\n**IOTAs new tokenomics comes through \u201cDust protection\u201d**\n\nThe tokenization update comes together with a second update called \u201cDust protection\u201d, which will tie up the whole picture and will reveal IOTAs new tokenomics.\n\nIOTAs feeless nature leads to a very unique problem. As in every distributed ledger (DLT), including all blockchains, all addresses on the ledger must be saved on the hard-drives of all participating nodes in the network. Addresses use up real, physical disk-space in other people real computers. As anyone can imagine, saving the data or balances from 1000 addresses uses up less disk-space than 1 million or even 1 billion addresses. This becomes a problem when someone uses IOTAs feeless protocol to simply take 1 MIOTA (1 million IOTAs, currently worth around $1.30) and send each individual IOTA to 1 million individual addresses on the Tangle. The result would be an exploding data-base that nodes would be unable to handle. Moreover, this damage would be permanent, since nobody could ever retrieve all these micro-amounts (called \u201cdust\u201d) from these addresses.\n\n**The solution: Link database-usage to ownership of IOTA tokens**\n\nDatabase size is a scarce resource. This means its use should be given to those who are invested into the protocol.\n\nThis will work as follows: Every UTXO, be it a SimpleOutput or one of the more complex ExtendenOutputs, has a certain data size. Outputs will be only allowed to exist in the Tangle, if they are backed up by a **IOTA token deposit** that lies on the same UTXO. The size of the deposit will be proportional to the space they take up in the shared database. This means that a SimpleOutput will have the lowest possible deposits, since it carries no additional data except address and token amount. NFTs or token foundries will vary in size, but will always require larger parts of the database and therefore need larger IOTA token deposits. This deposit-mechanism also enables **arbitrary data to be permanently saved** on the Tangle, simply by adding an IOTA token deposit to any data transaction (for example to permanently store digital identities)\n\nThe IOTA token deposits can either sit on the receivers address or they can be part of the senders transaction. In that second case the sender can either gift the deposit amount to the receiver or get it back by making use of the new \u201creturn-amount\u201d functionalities, which effectively work as very simple smart contracts that get automatically triggered once the receivers UTXO gets consumed or a defined amount of time passes.\n\nAll deposits can be claimed back by the owner of the respective UTXO at any time \u2013 Data and NFTs can be deleted, foundries can be dissolved, in order to release their connected IOTA token deposits.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**So, how much of a deposit are we talking?**\n\nThe details are more complicated but in short:\n\n**SimpleOutputs:** will probably require around 0.5 -1 Mi deposit\n\n**ExtendedOutputs:** strongly depending on individual size of the output, but probably mostly around 0.5 \u2013 20 Mi\n\nThe IOTA token deposits directly link the limited resource \u201cdatabase size\u201d (for example defined as 1 Tb) to the limited resource \u201cIOTA tokens\u201d (there are about 2.8 billion Mega-IOTA in existence). This means the deposit costs will be directly derived from the yet-to-be-made decision on the **maximum database size** of the Tangle. This choice cannot be made lightly, since it will set strong limits on what kinds of nodes will be able to participate in the network. If the database size is chosen to be very high, the necessary deposits can be very low. But then only very strong and performant nodes can realistically follow the network, thereby reducing decentralization. If a very low maximum database size is chosen, many smaller nodes can participate but token deposits will be very high, since a given number of bytes is a larger piece of the total cake.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What does this mean for IOTA token demand?**\n\nSince the upcoming update has two parts it also means two different but intertwined things:\n\n1. Tokenization update vastly increases possible use-cases\n2. Dust protection update links EVERY use-case to IOTA token demand\n\nThe increased usability will attract more use-cases, from serious business to meme-coins. The dust protection will make sure every use-case increases token demand.\n\nFor example, token foundries can create new tokens almost for free, but **whoever wants to receive them must have a minimum IOTA token deposit** **in their possession**. Everyone can cheaply and without wasting much energy create NFTs, but **whoever wants to hold them must hold a minimum IOTA token deposit** too! Government, industry and individuals will pin important data into the Tangle by linking a deposit to it, thereby locking up parts of the total supply. Digital identities will be stored on the main-layer and thereby lock up even more.\n\nIn short: **Any kind of network usage will increase demand for the IOTA token and will therefore increase its price.**\n\n**Quick maths:**\n\nThere are only \\~2.8 billion MIOTAs around (assuming zero have been lost)\n\nIf the average IOTA token deposit would lie at around 1 Mi there would not be enough UTXOs for every human being on this planet, let alone every machine (cars, smart homes, IoT sensors, etc).\n\nThis means data-space on the Tangle (and therefore IOTA tokens) could become extremely valuable.\n\nThe potential implications of this for the end-game vision of IOTA (from \u201cnetwork for everyones coffee buy\u201d to \u201cfundamental base-layer of trust\u201d) will be discussed in a future article.\n\n**Wen?**\n\nBoth the tokenization and dust protection updates are currently well advanced RFCs (request for comment documents). They will need further review before they will be implemented on the IOTA Chrysalis testnet for intense and thorough testing. After that the IOTA Foundation will aim for mainnet release, which must also be very carefully prepared. Don\u2019t expect mainnet release of these updates very soon, but follow their progress on Chrysalis testnet, IOTA Discord and Twitter in order to stay up-to-date.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**If you like my content consider to leave a tip:**\n\niota1qpnlkzvc3gk4p8u8xs7sj2wfncz3wcme5xt0yj8243h6mf4pn4azzuge63t\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Sources:**\n\nIOTA tokenization blogpost: [https://blog.iota.org/iota-tokenization-framework-specifications/](https://blog.iota.org/iota-tokenization-framework-specifications/)\n\nDust protection RFC: [https://github.com/muXxer/protocol-rfcs/blob/master/text/0039-dust-protection-based-on-byte-costs/0039-dust-protection-based-on-byte-costs.md](https://github.com/muXxer/protocol-rfcs/blob/master/text/0039-dust-protection-based-on-byte-costs/0039-dust-protection-based-on-byte-costs.md)",

Perhaps ask your collegeues, quietly of course, if any teachers have ever 'gone missing'?\n\nTry talking about: Forced sterilisations, work camps, snitches, people going missing for having political opinions, domestic abuse, treatment of minorities such as disabled. You are a teacher, you should be free to talk about issues otherwise you are a blunt instrument of the state. \n\nThere is and remains a big difference between losing face and rewriting the history books.

        "post_body": "As I brought to our attention a week or so ago [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Iota/comments/7kf2ox/unfortunately_the_iota_troll_addsaudiotovideo_is/), the IOTA troll AddsAudiotoVideo had been made a moderator of the subreddit /r/CryptoCurrency, a place with which many of us have a love/hate relationship. For many of us this was the last straw and unquestionable proof that they were systematically biased against IOTA. Every future front page post removal only confirmed this further in many of our minds.\n\nThis event caused a *strong* outrage within our community across various social media platforms and we all dealt with it in different ways. I initially publically confronted one of the central mods about this [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7ko132/this_sub_should_be_neutral_and_not_a_place_where/drgcgyb/) when I saw him participating in a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7ko132/this_sub_should_be_neutral_and_not_a_place_where/) that was calling out what we considered CryptoCurrency's obvious bias against our community. To his absolute credit, despite having abuse thrown at him from all sides, /u/crypto_buddha gave [a professional reply](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7ko132/this_sub_should_be_neutral_and_not_a_place_where/drgcwvv/) and asked if I could provide examples of AddsAudiotoVideo's behaviour. I did that [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7ko132/this_sub_should_be_neutral_and_not_a_place_where/drggouq/) and /u/crypto_buddha said that he would investigate the issue, then following it up with the statement shown below:\n\n> Given the size of our community I personally believe that we should be trying to set positive standards for all crypto subreddits. I often have faith in most people to do the right thing, it's important to research the situations correctly and ask the right questions, something I encourage more users to do. So leave this with me and we will pick it back up this week :)\n\nThe story above is from my perspective but many different people sent mod reports, wrote posts, shared screenshots to twitter and generally brought this issue to the centre of attention and kept it there.\n\nJumping forward to today, I recieved [this](https://imgur.com/fQ5vXDY) screenshot from someone I know through the IOTA community, shortly followed by a [direct message](https://imgur.com/M6NuKYJ) to me, in which /u/crypto_buddha informed us that the decision had been made to strip AddsAudiotoVideo of his moderator position in the /r/CryptoCurrency subreddit. A check of the [moderator list](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/about/moderators) will confirm this.\n\nI'd like to take this opportunity to sincerely thank the moderators of /r/CryptoCurrency who, after being informed by the IOTA community about the issues surrounding this user, took everyones opinions seriously (even those who were less than polite in their method of communication) and investigated the issue. Removing this user from the position of power that he was mistakenly given should be a clear sign that the /r/CryptoCurrency moderators are genuinely trying hard to be fair and unbiased. **This huge victory seems like a great time to take a deep breath and try to clear the air.** Lets work *with* the moderators to keep /r/CryptoCurrency a positive and constructive place.\n\nThanks to all involved,\n\nBlahehblah",

The class laughed along with him, but I always thought clich\u00e9s got a bum rap. Because, often, they're dead-on.

Nothing could more correctly describe the initial moments of my reunion with Rahim Khan.\u201d \u2013The Kite Runner\n\n**While perhaps clich\u00e9, nothing could more correctly describe this moment in time than to say: There is never going to be a better time to buy some Electroneum. Here is why.**\n\nThere will come a day when we are talking about ETN in dollars, not cents. Yes, dollars. You will hear so many saying how ETN is cheap and it\u2019s a great time to get in now *after* we return to $0.20 and well above\u2026If you take 1 minute and read this through to the very end, only then will you clearly see why.\n\nLet\u2019s sum up the last 5 days\u2019 major news and developments:  **1. Electroneum Director Chris Gorman, OBE, along with the rest of the Electroneum Team have secured a top 10 exchange, Coinbene; 2. There was a perfectly executed, smooth hard fork on ETN\u2019s blockchain to finally put an end to the hash-raids; and 3. Electroneum got approved by Apple for iOS Beta.**\n\nFor those who constantly attacked Electroneum and the Team behind it, here you go. The world will now know that few stood up against many and despite all odds the good prevailed against evil.\n\nApple is one of, if not the most, critical and scrutinizing organizations for allowing any crypto the keys to its castle: The App Store. And yet, here we are: As of July 6th Apple has officially granted Electroneum access. No more can FUDsters call ETN a $hitcoin or a scam. Now, finally, ETN for everyone: Apple iPhone users will be ecstatic to hear that Apple gave its blessing on the iOS Beta. Soon you will be able to enjoy Electroneum\u2019s new App.\n\n[President & Ceo Richards Ells](https://reddit.com/link/8x2eim/video/mgwntfd2gq811/player)\n\nRight now, with this amount of news and developments (and even more massive announcements to come), the 1 question you must ask yourself is not whether this coin will fly; rather, you must only ask yourself how high?\n\n[https://twitter.com/coinbene/status/1014850882477817857](https://twitter.com/coinbene/status/1014850882477817857)\n\nCoinBene is a Singapore-based exchange with approximately $2.0 billion of trading volume, according to Coinmarketcap. Just to give you an idea how massive this is, here are some stats on the exchanges: CoinBene sits in the top position with about $2.0 billion of trading volume, Bit-Z meanwhile holds down second place with $1.25 billion of volume, and OKEx is in third place with approximately $913 million. Binance, meanwhile, is a distant fourth with a trading volume of $602 million, followed by Huobi, Bitfinex, ZB, Bibox, HitBTC, and Upbit in the top 10.\n\nIn the 2-minute exclusive above with Electroneum President and CEO Richard Ells, he describes his vision and a plan with **2 and 5 year goals**. In order to achieve these goals changes needed to be made to the blockchain to accommodate the massive flood of new ETN users that will soon be coming (ETN already is on the heels of 2.0 Million users and is on course to pass this milestone any day now\u2026). It was a must and absolute necessity to introduce the ASICS back into the platform.\n\nBy having a dedicated ASIC mining base (as opposed to miners who can switch at will) provides significantly more security. Blockchain communities should embrace ASIC development on their networks rather than resist it. Many developers in the cryptocurrency world say that the fears of centralization are overblown and that ASICs actually improve the security of a cryptocurrency network by making them harder to dominate with raw computing power.\n\nWith large GPU-based mining operations there is a lot of jumping from coin to coin and mining the most profitable coin.  ETN was abused by them for much too long. For smaller networks in particular, like ETN at the moment, high volatility in hash rate (caused by large scale miners \u201cjumping\u201d between coins) did pose a threat as it could lead to less stability and security, thus increasing vulnerability. This was certainly a factor why Electroneum had to take these actions (and indeed some of the best and most swiftly executed actions I have seen so far). Big exchanges are looking for stable coins with no drama. I am happy to see CoinBene listing ETN, and they will need a stable block chain like the one we now have to sustain the power of a big exchange.\n\nIt was not a matter if, but when, someone would come along with enough rented hash power and raid the network for 51&#37;. Can I tell you, had that happened you would see the same group of people pointing their fingers that the dev team is doing a crappy job and why they did not stop it. Well guess what: ETN has stopped the monster everyone was afraid of. This was a BRILLIANT move and no one had seen it coming -- JOB WELL DONE ETN! Keep it up \u2013 in no time you will become the coin that everyone is forced to reckon with.\n\n**Consider this:** 20 Million ETN users (and quite possibly more). If each only has just 1,000 ETN that is the entire circulating supply. \u2026and there are many, many, many users who hold millions of ETN.  There will come a day when we are talking about ETN in dollars, not cents. Yes, dollars. And now you see why.\n\n[The coin that will change the world](https://preview.redd.it/1r3idlychq811.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eccefbbb2d6bcf85a498c7bb14c2e05ed7e7f094)\n\n**Bonus:**\n\nHere is a little something extra for the entire Electroneum community including those who disagree, gave up or lost faith in this coin/project, it is not too late to get back in the game you know! To all of the die hard fans and supporters out there, youtubers, ETN Telegram Channels KQ, The Army, Knights, ETN Main, ETN Business, ETN Price, Discords and Reddit Channels/Teams. To all the admins keeping the peace on reddit and telegram moderating the content and putting up with a lot of nonsense and assisting the ones who needed their help. To all and any individuals that had contributed in any way what so ever directly or indirectly, if you are sitting on the sidelines and want to get involved **join us** we are looking forward to working with you. Special Thanks to the Electroneum Media and Dev Teams who worked through all the fud,  hate, manipulation and the name calling. Finally, to the ETN Executive Team  Mr. Ells & Mr. Gorman for slaving 100+ hours a week and delivering on their promises.  Thank you all for a Job Well Done or as we like to say: Bravo Zulu (BZ)!

In 2 hours (around 1pm CT), Jake (/u/BCDS-IoT), a Market Research Analyst, and Chris (/u/HokieKoch), a Field Applications Engineer, will drop in and begin answering questions. Below is a brief introduction writeup they've provided for this AMA:\n\n> Hello everyone! We are North America's Bosch Connected Devices & Solutions, we have created a suite of connected devices and work on making tailor-made solutions for the Internet of Things. Our device portfolio includes our Telematics eCall Plug (TEP), our Transport Data Logger (TDL), our Connected Industrial Sensor Solution (CISS), and our Cross Domain Development Kit (XDK), which most of you are familiar with.\n\n> The XDK is a rapid prototyping tool and programmable sensor device. It consists of an accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, humidity sensor, pressure sensor, temperature sensor, acoustic sensor, and digital light sensor. The device allows you to monitor machines and environments remotely over Bluetooth or Wireless, allowing you to visualize and analyze the data on the Frontend. By doing this, it enables your devices, products, and machines to become IoT ready and transforms them into smart devices. As we saw in the live demo, the data that the XDK gathers is an example of the data that can be bought/sold via the Tangle.\n\n> We hope to answer any questions you have regarding the XDK. This could be anything from the technical specs of the device itself to potential use cases or what problems it solves. If we are unable to get through all of the questions in the allotted time, we will be checking back periodically to answer the still open questions. We look forward to hearing your questions!\n\nPlease try to keep your questions on topic. /u/BCDS-IoT and /u/HokieKoch will begin answering your questions in roughly 2 hours. ",

NEO is just 40x in advance against Ethereum, when I see neotracker.io for example, the system of Gas or ICOs that will be in the next months?\nEthereum has unfortunately became a garbage of useless ICO and scammers.\n\n\n*\n\n**Edit:** Due to number of comments I have to explain a little more my decision. By meaning garbage of useless ICO, I mean that only 1% of ERC20-based are real projects. If you are old in this game, just remember the GNO disaster, just look at the [richest token page](https://etherscan.io/tokenrichlist), who can prove that a manipulation is not possible? Why GNO team has more than $1,5B of their token? I mean it's like 95%. They can withdraw them on 200 days. And the market cap will be $1,5B? No of all. GNO will crash instantly, ETH and others will follow. People (and me) have used ICO too much and the system is done. Just look at District0x or BlockCat, and their cap in comparison with June with Status or Bancor (btw, I think I will never understand why a team will $150M to build a website or a single iphone app, but pass). \n\nAnother example, [EOS and their fucking infinity ICO](https://eosscan.io/), why the fuck do you explain that they have right now 1,1M ETH (and it's still running), why don't you think that they can cash out all of them one day? (because they do it each day) They don't even have a fucking product. It's just advertising, now you have put 1% of total ETH on greedy hands. I am sorry but I will never feel more as confiant as at the beginning on the Ethereum system.\n\nSo, okay, Ethereum has EEA and many future, but I feel more confiant about NEO's future with China and regulation, than all of this world of scammers/stealers on the Ethereum blockchain (that don't mean that NEO is safe, but for now, it is). \n\n\n**That's not the technology behind Ethereum that I critic, but the use that have been made during the past year. I explain my worry about what some greedy team behind huge ICO can do with *our* ETH.**\n\nNEO has still a lot to prove for all of us, and this is a **real working product**. \n\n*\n\nI was a proud hodler of Ethereum since feb 2016, now I have converted all of them and I have to say that I am full-NEO. The next Ethereum. The 2.0.\n\nSorry about grammar",

Their promise was that the earliest adopters will benefit the most, which was necessary in order to entice people in the first place.\n\nNow, natural selection comes in at play here very well. The beginning is clearly not easy. We are met with tons of volatile swings and uncertainties early on in this game (my prediction is that won't end until decentralized exchanges arrive), which is likely to weed out the ones who dont see what this tech is to become. I am evidence of this because while i was in University I actually started mining Dogecoin back when that was blowing up in 2014 (or 2013 dont remember). Anyways, I thought crypto's would make me rich then, but I wanted that short term relief which did not happen. The Mt. Gox drama appeared and then slowly after I just abandoned the 30 bucks of crypto I mined...\n\ntoday that 30 bucks would be worth 300 in BTC. not even a month's worth of mining on a crappy GTX 660 back then. I am back now because I finally understand what blockchain is capable of. Back then I saw it as just another hacker's play-toy (I always wanted to learn how to hack lol). \n\nI predict that this cycle of weeding will continue, perhaps even worse. That is going to filter out the weasels who shouldn't be here in the first place. Of course some bad people will make it to the top too, but at the end of the day we are only human, and although we are close to creating the perfect trading system there will always be room for improvement. Chances are the weaker players are going to fall behind by not following the tech. I don't generally like speaking about future predictions, but from a tech point of view it isn't too difficult to realize that BTC will lose its value once people realize there is nothing that special or innovative about it. It is outdated technology already."

I recently started working on a new project that follows the same crypto-privacy fashion as KYCnotme. \n\nIt's called [iseeyour.cash](https://iseeyour.cash). Basically it's a search engine where you can search for Reddit usernames. It will scrap all user's comments and posts and try to find if they have ever published a **crypto address**. If they did, it will save it on a database and will check the blockchain to find its balance. Right now it supports Bitcoin, Ethereum and Nano addresses.\n\nYou can try it out using my username [hoiru](https://iseeyour.cash/u/hoiru). I commented some addresses to test and I will be leaving them. I also recommend [reading the about page](https://iseeyour.cash/about).\n\nIf you want to further test it, you can go to [this post on r/cc](https://reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pztksp/hi_redditors_im_giving_away_110_nano_500_and/) where a lot of users commented their NANO addresses, or you can search for similar posts.\n\nThis project was made to try to make people a little more conscious of the importance of financial privacy and the disaster with transparent blockchains if somehow an address gets linked to your identity. I also [mention](https://iseeyour.cash/about#wcid) **Monero** as the only option to solve this.\n\nFor now, it only works with Reddit usernames but I plan to add support for other social networks such as Twitter.\n\nI hope you like it, I will be hearing any suggestions and improvements that can be made to this. This is a first version, so you may find some bugs. If this is the case, please report them.\n\nDisclaimer: I am not a web developer, so there may be errors. For now, I will not publish it over [r/cc](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency) or other subs as I want to test it for a while. Thank you!",

I am still concerned that the price of transactions is too low.\n\nThe cost per GB of HDD space is going down - so I'm less worried about increasing blockchain size.\n\nWhat does concern me is the validation time required for nodes, as more and more transactions pile up.\n\nI think transaction fees should stay cheap, but be high enough that one has to question whether or not to make the transaction if they don't definitely need to. \n\nSo that would mean fees less than $1, but more than 5 cents. Something in that range.\n\nAm fairly sure (at least some) other members of the community share similar concerns."

        "post_title": "The Case for XRP in 2018",
        "post_body": "Cryptocurrencies have grown exponentially not only in price this past year but also in public awareness and popular attention. The novel feeling to an emerging financial and technological market is reminiscent of the rise of the Internet with its innovative potential. In turn, a heightened collective societal awareness of this new innovative potential has led to a change in the nature of the market dynamics of cryptocurrencies. As Heisenberg\u2019s Uncertainty Principle posits, \u201cThe observation of a phenomenon changes the phenomena itself.\u201d The observation of thousands of young millennials, and now middle-aged investors, will only accelerate the rise of cryptocurrencies as times goes on.\n\nToday, we are seeing the real-world effects of a newfound intrigue into cryptocurrencies. This new interest is causing a narrowing of the divergence between truth and fiction over accurate knowledge about cryptocurrencies. The force drawing this gap narrower each day is an increased dissemination of truthful information that has generated legions of individual investors into new cryptocurrency markets; in particular, Ripple\u2019s XRP.\n\nAs the public expands its understanding of Ripple\u2019s XRP, the capital inflow from both individual and institutional investors combined will likely grow to levels that will exponentially grow the liquidity of XRP and, as a byproduct, its price.\n\nHere, in this report, I will provide an overview and analysis of Ripple\u2019s XRP and the implications Q4 2017 and the year 2018 and beyond hold for the future of XRP and its price.\n\n**THE CONCEPT: WHAT IS XRP?**\n\nXRP is the digital asset used by Ripple to offer financial institutions an option for liquidity to conduct cross-border payments. It is predominantly used for Ripple\u2019s solution for the minimization of liquidity costs. In contrast to most other cryptocurrencies, XRP\u2019s application here features a real-world applicability that extends to real-world transactions.  It is used for the xRapid solution provided by Ripple, and is the only one of the three solutions Ripple offers (The others are xCurrent and xVia) that employs the use of XRP.\n\n**THE RATIONALE: WHY XRP?**\n\nThere is a myriad of factors that distinguish XRP from other cryptocurrencies and establish it as a forerunner to what may become the dominant cryptocurrencies in the years that lie ahead.\n\nCost: Comparatively, XRP has the lowest cost per transaction at $0.0004. In contrast, BCH is $0.26, LTC is $0.37, DASH is $0.64, ETH is $0.96, and BTC is $28.23.\n\nScalability: XRP can handle over 1,500 transactions per second whereas BCH can handle 24 per second, LTC can handle 56 per second, DASH can handle 10 per second, ETH can handle 16 per second, and BTC can handle 24 per second.\n\nSpeed: XRP can conduct transactions at a rate of 3 seconds per transaction, BCH at a rate of 58 minutes per transaction, LTC at 17 minutes per transaction, DASH at 15 minutes per transaction, ETH at 2 minutes per transaction, and BTC 1 hour and 6 minutes per transaction.\n\nXRP\u2019s availability is ever-expanding. It is currently available on over 50 exchanges including Bitstamp, Bithumb, Bittrex, Binance, Bitfinex, Kraken, and Poloniex. The volume of XRP availability is, in addition, in an expansionary phase. The primary location of exchange volume is concentrated in Asia; in particular, South Korea. However, as mainstream media attention increases, so will American interest as well. There already have been tell-tale signs indicative in news outlets that have covered Ripple recently in the wake of XRP\u2019s rise in CNBC, Bloomberg, Forbes, Investopedia, and Yahoo Finance.\n\nSimply consider the mania generated by the media attention to Bitcoin. Repetitive news stories featured on CNBC, Bloomberg, CNN, CBS, and other mainstream media news outlets. Countless articles disparaging it as a bubble and hailing it as a force that could deconstruct the financial apparatus governed by the Federal Reserve and other central banks. Now, consider the results of media attention directed towards the substantive information behind XRP. Once news segments and articles are shown and written that illustrate the comparative superiority of XRP to other cryptocurrencies, then the viewers and readers will likely flock to XRP in pursuit of acquiring a tried, tested, and proven cryptocurrency with real-world usage.\n\nIn turn, a virtuous circle intensifying capital inflow to XRP is predictable and probably to occur. We can expect FOMO to rise and a number of oscillations up and down for the price to unfold. Nevertheless, the price of XRP is bound to not only remain but rather accelerate its demonstrated upwards price trajectory pushing us to new heights.\n\nAdditionally, if the collective fear among cryptocurrency investors materializes, that is, if new regulations are imposed on our activities, then Ripple is stand to likely gain. Dr. Nassim Nicholas Taleb, a scholar and risk analyst writes about a concept called \u201cAntifragility.\u201d Antifragility is a term used to describe things that gain from disorder. Considering Ripple\u2019s ties to financial institutions and regulators, it wouldn\u2019t be too far-off to speculate that XRP is positioned to gain if such a black swan event were to occur.\n\n**FURTHER REASONS TO ADVANCE THE CASE FOR XRP:**\n\nFinancial institutions, renown investors, and accomplished financiers have already taken notice of XRP. Former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke has advocated on Ripple\u2019s behalf. Zoe Cruz, former president for institutional securities and wealth management at Morgan Stanley and former global head of fixed income, commodities, and foreign exchange has joined Ripple\u2019s Board of Directors. She has been named to Forbes list of Most Powerful Women for three years straight.\n\nPerhaps most notably, a consortium of 61 banks \u2013 organized by SBI Ripple Asia \u2013 will be adopting Ripple\u2019s technology to settle transactions between its members with the eventual goal of applying XRP to usage. Mr. Yoshitaka Kitao, the CEO, Executive Chairman, and President has publicly stated, \u201cForget about bitcoin, we\u2019re all in on XRP!\u201d  In fact, SBI has already confirmed that XRP will be put in usage in Spring 2018. If successful, expect the price to reflect it.\n\nMoreover, TechCrunch Founder Michael Arrington has, as of November 2017, announced a $100 million XRP hedge fund. His efforts have already raised $50 million which will engender a ripple effect of new large net-worth individual and institutional investors. The entity will be called Arrington XRP Capital and new information about its activities are set to be released in the months that lie ahead.\n\nAlso, David Schwartz, Ripple\u2019s Chief Cryptographer, has said that there are two major \u201chousehold\u201d companies (Not financial institutions) that will be announced in Q4. This is likely to provide a substantial boon to XRP.\n\nFinally, the Chief Technology Officer of Ripple, Stefan Thomas, has said that in 2018 there will be a \u201cbig push on XRP.\u201d For years, Ripple has kept a relative silence in expressing the superiority of XRP. 2018 will be different. 2018 is bound to be Ripple\u2019s year. **I expect the price to rise as high as $10** and as low as $4. \n\nAt any rate, this report only scratches the surface of Ripple and XRP\u2019s potential. For far more nuanced and in-depth analysis and information, I suggest reading from Ripple firsthand at www.ripple.com and perusing the best blog on XRP itself at https://xrphodor.wordpress.com/\n\nTo the moon, we go.\n\nSOURCE: https://cellardoorway.com/2017/12/24/the-case-for-ripples-xrp-a-brief-overview/",

There's only been people here and on XMR trader shouting for months that exchanges directly invovled with new Tether prints are probably fractionally reserved. We've been explaining that they're probably using any real Monero on their exchanges to maintain leveraged shorts with price suppression. And that's in addition to the naked short that selling non-existent Monero actually is.\n\nIf you leave your XMR on BitFinex, Poloniex, Binance, Huobi, or any exchange that receives new Tether prints, you're hurting us. Use a *reputable* regulated exchange if you're gonna trade. Kraken is probably the best here, and they're very likely fully reserved. They're trying to integrate into the banking system, and generally can't afford to do those kinds of manipulation and lies.\n\nOr just use a decentralized exchange. Or better yet, *stop trading.* Most people get rekt doing it. We need to squeeze the shit out of liquidity on these price manipulators. It's time to put an end to this. They don't have loads of ASIC mined and premined Monero to dump on retail. They hate that they can't see the onchain flows. They want to suppress price and make Monero their own personal little laundromat.\n\nMonero is for *The People* not for a narrow set of corporate parasites.

        "post_body": "**IMPORTANT NOTE: ~~Some users are experiencing issues with funds availability after depositing and/or trying to withdrawal. Until this is sorted out I recommend not depositing funds to this wallet. This is the website linked to by Justin Sun's (Founder of TRON) twitter account @justinsuntron. If anyone receives any communication from TRON regarding this please post here~~  --  Those who were having this issue have reported that their transfers completely successfully, but took a significant amount of time. Average of about 20+ hours. However, it is the general consensus that it may be best to avoid depositing funds to this wallet until the site is more polished. At this point I recommend that you just register and activate the account and wait to see if the website improves and becomes more reliable in the future.**\n\n**UPDATE: *Infinitely loading captcha:* If you are getting the loading dots indefinitely while waiting for the Captcha to appear after clicking the Register button, try using a different web browser from what you currently are. Some have had Chrome work but not Firefox visa versa, others have only been able to get it to work on Microsoft Edge. Furthermore, some folks still can't get the captcha to load regardless of the browser they are using. In this case, a few people have been successful in registering by using a VPN and setting the location to Singapore. /u/m_kaito suggested Hola! VPN in chrome.\nFurthermore /u/ZaphreBR pointed out a JavaScript issue in the comment thread below.**\n\n***If you have this infinitely loading captcha issue and you get it to work, please let us know what steps worked for you so we can compile a list of potential solutions to help everyone get registered!***\n\n**UPDATE 2:  *Deposits / Withdrawals:* Translation is not working for some people on the profile screen, leading to confusion on how to deposit or withdraw funds. The top left box is for BTC, top right is ETH, and bottom left is TRX. Within the boxes, the two buttons on the right are the Deposit and Withdrawal buttons. The top is Deposit, the bottom is Withdrawal. Here is a screenshot of the translated version so you can get a visual.** \n https://imgur.com/9Knz1KK \n\nBetween Reddit and several other forums I have seen dozens of users asking for help with registering on the TRON website. As such, I decided to put together a quick tutorial for anyone having trouble registering, either because of the language barrier or whatever else the reason may be.\n\n*Why should I register on the TRON website?*\n\nIn this Forbes article, Justin Sun, Founder of TRON ($TRX), announced there would be a \"considerable\" reward for the first million wallets registered. \nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/rogeraitken/2017/08/12/could-this-millennial-crypto-tech-visionary-be-the-next-jack-ma\n\n>\u201cWe are very confident that TRON will reach a target of one million wallets registered within a year. The first million registered users will be rewarded with considerable TRX tokens by registering on the TRON platform.\u201d\n\n\n*OK, so how do I register my wallet to get in on this?*\n\nRegistering on the site has proven to be easier said than done. This tutorial will walk you through the process step by step so you can get your wallet registered and activated.\n\n**Step 1.  Go the the TRON home page.**\n\nNavigate to https://tronlab.com/en.html and click Regist [sic] at the top right.\n\n - https://imgur.com/GvAHtgD\n\n**Step 2.  Register your account**\n\nA registration form will appear. Starting at the top, the boxes are Email Address, Username, Password, and Confirm Password. Fill out this form and click the Registered [sic] button. Solve the captcha, then click the confirm button in the notification box that pops up. \n\n*NOTE:* If you receive any errors when submitting the form, they will be shown in Chinese. You can copy/paste them into google translate to translate them to your preferred language. From doing this I learned the password requirements are simply that it must be between 4 and 12 characters long. \n\n - https://imgur.com/s0qIZIs\n\n**Step 3.  Navigate to your profile page**\n\nAfter you have registered, you will be taken back to the home page. At the top you will now see a stock profile picture and a Logout button. Click the profile picture to proceed to your profile page where you can finish activating your account and interact with your wallet.\n\n - https://imgur.com/TLCVnlJ\n\n**Step 4.  Activate your account**\n\nOnce you are in your profile, you will see a gold \"Activate the account\" button at the top right.  \n\n - https://imgur.com/NybdM2p\n\nClick that button and it will say \"Sending email...\". A few seconds later another seemingly blank confirmation box pops up. \n\n - https://imgur.com/tLzQ9C7\n\nHowever, the text is just the same color as the background and can't be seen. Press Ctrl+A to highlight the text and make it vi-visible. \n\n - https://imgur.com/HwiQE6V\n\nClick the Confirm button and proceed to verify your email.\n\n**Step 5.  Confirm your email**\n\nNow login to your email account and click the link in the verification email you received. It is written in Chinese so it will likely end up in the spam folder. After confirming your email, log back into your account on the TRON website. You will now see that the \"Activate the account\" button is no longer there. \n\n - https://imgur.com/1rQRy3D\n\n**Done!**\n\nYou have now successfully registered and activated your TRON wallet on the TRON Platform! At this point you can fund your wallet from your profile screen if you choose to do so.\n\n**Happy Investing!**",

        "body": "I have seen no mention of it, but there has been little to no mention of the website in general. Presumably they are putting everything they have into the platform code, especially with the open source release only a few days away. Generally, we are assuming that they will hopefully address the website some time toward the beginning of 2018. \nAnd honestly, considering the fact that the TRX tokens we currently own will be exchanged for the new ones specific to the platform, this may just be a temporary wallet for thise until the new platform launches. All pure speculation at this point. "

        "post_body": "&#x200B;\n\n[Instant Payments](https://reddit.com/link/9vk2ts/video/tpuxda7568921/player)\n\nTrue story:\n\nOn the heels of shooting this video I showed my wife how we can use Electroneum\u2019s mobile app to transfer even massive sums of money instantly with ETN, and so cheaply that it\u2019s almost free.\n\nShe shot me a pleasantly surprised look and asked, \u201cWhy isn\u2019t everyone using this?\u201d I replied, \u201cThey will.\u201d\n\n**----------------**\n\n**Expanded on Below:**\n\n**1. Apple iOS Listing Will Bring an Even Greater Sense of Security**\n\n**2. All You Need is Your Phone**\n\n**3. iPhone Users, ETN, & Pareto\u2019s Principle**\n\n**4. UNLIMITED Transactions Per Second (TPS)**\n\n**5. Electroneum \u2013 Light Years Ahead Now**\n\n**----------------**\n\n**1. Apple iOS Listing Will Bring an Even Greater Sense of Security**\n\nFrom utilizing HackerOne to offering cold storage exchange solutions like Liquid, Electroneum has been and continues to be extremely thorough in its security measures surrounding the project. Apple\u2019s approval of Electroneum\u2019s iOS App gives an even greater sense of security because of Apple\u2019s long history of being very strict, and in most cases prohibitive, listing Cryptocurrency apps, wallets, and so on in their App store.\n\nAdditionally, this sense of security coupled with the  iOS App\u2019s listing  \u2013 in and of itself \u2013 may place more demand on ETN than several partnerships or corporate deals would (see #3 below). The reason is simple and it has to do with the spending habits of iPhone users collectively as a demographic; you see, this is a group that \u2013 as a whole \u2013 will not be primarily concerned with the mobile/cloud mining feature. Rather, iPhone users by and large will obtain substantial balances of ETN to use as a means of exchange for goods, services, and investment.  Of course there will be some small minority of iPhone users who value a mining solution, so the team is working diligently to provide that before fully releasing the app.\n\nFor this sneak peak at the Apple iOS App beta we very intentionally decided to do a large transaction to show how easily ETN also works for spending large amounts; and while they are not the target per se (viz. unbanked developing world), iPhone users may very well move significantly more volume of ETN than any other market demographic.\n\n**2. All You Need is Your Phone**\n\nThe same intuitive Electroneum Mobile App that already has over 1 million downloads from the Google App Play Store has now been fully approved by Apple, and as Richard Ells tells us in his most recent interview: He expects the iOS App fully released this quarter. We expect this would mean imminently, especially with the beta performing flawlessly for many months.  So all you need is your phone: The mobile app Electroneum has created truly is the key to usability, growth, and adoption.\n\n**3. iPhone Users, ETN, & Pareto\u2019s Principle**\n\nThe metrics of any performance driven space are typically and most often observed to have the top 20% outperforming the entire bottom 80% in that space (viz. Pareto\u2019s Principle). Crypto is no exception; the top 20% of projects by market cap outperform the bottom 80%.\n\nIf you take a look at the fact that about 20% of smartphones are iPhones, this may be deceivingly important (i.e. \u201cWhy be concerned with that market?\u201d). **But we know** iPhone **users, as a market demographic, spend significantly more money \u2013 make more transactions \u2013 than the 80% who are other-brand smartphone users.**\n\nWhile true this demographic typically does not represent the individuals in the target demographic of Electroneum (viz. the unbanked); it is not only possible, but highly plausible iPhone **users (20% of market) may very well account for 80% of ETN transactions. Even if they do not, the volume of ETN moved by iPhones will still be absolutely momentous because of the consistent history of this demographic\u2019s spending habits.**\n\n**4. UNLIMITED Transactions Per Second (TPS)**\n\nWith Electroneum\u2019s patent pending Instant Payment System (IPS), gone are the issues concerning TPS for payment processing speeds. Much the same as a massive exchange processes countless transactions at any given moment; Electroneum\u2019s IPS executes an unlimited number of transfers with a guarantee of deposit confirmed by the blockchain. (Traditional transfers of ETN using conventional blockchain methods without IPS can still be done, but require longer to see confirmation of the transaction.)\n\n**5. Electroneum \u2013 Light Years Ahead Now**\n\nIf we take a look at the rate of adoption of ETN we see it is starting to accelerate as Electroneum approaches 3 million registered users. The intuitive mobile app and IPS technology have geared it specifically for mass adoption; Electroneum is light years ahead now, ready to accept institutional investors with corporate products and stay well within the boundaries of regulatory framework.\n\nBy combining instant transactions and ease of integration in a single system, Electroneum has made it extremely simple to conduct business whether it be phone to phone, phone to Point of Sale, e-commerce, and so on. The KYC regulatory compliance and IPS integration truly are the perfect complement to each other and a breakthrough in technology, making ETN the fastest and easiest cryptocurrency to use. We are so excited for the upcoming release of Electroneum\u2019s Apple iOS App \u2013 truly ETN\u2019s next big step towards mass adoption.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[www.electroneum.com](https://preview.redd.it/vaea2139oax11.jpg?width=1497&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1b0f9d29ae6eb1933ec13b3960a8cbed548f672a)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

To call it \"investing\" is both misleading and unethical because what you are doing is *speculating*. It's pure gambling. Some people will read about you \"investing\" and conclude that it's possible to \"invest\" in crypto and expect similar experiences as with regulated investments. Nothing illegal about it, but.... those claiming to be ethical are more often than not the most unethical. If you were ethical, you wouldn't feel the need to tell the world about it."

I'm focusing on the fundamentals right now, like what is a Blockchain and all that, and how mining works etc. \n\nBut obviously a significant topic of conversation at the moment is the bitcoin coin split. I've read about this topic too, of course, but I'm finding the things I've read don't seem to square with the massive amount of hate that seems to exist between the two camps. I go to this subreddit and it's pretty open disdain for those who support BCH and I go to r/btc and it's vice versa. \n\nI'm trying to understand the mutual hatred here. A technical change like a fork and a decision between bigger and smaller blocks doesn't seem like something that would necessarily infused with such mutual hatred.... but here we are.\n\nTo try and understand this a bit more - including the politics behind the divide - does anyone have any articles they've come across that they have found explains the issue well? Even if it is one-sided, if it defends its position we'll, I'd still be interested in reading it, while keeping in mind the bias of the writer.\n\nI'm just trying to understand the situation more, so any link to articles you have found helpful would be much appreciated!!\n\nEdit 1: Holy crap!  This blew up! I'm in Korea (cryptocurrencies are big here!!) at the moment, and woke up to a veritable gold mine of information here, so I'm just getting to work through all the comments that were added since last night now!  So trust me; I'm making my way through all of this!  \n\nI also want to say - for such a contentious topic (where it is clear there is a lot of history and where many of you have thrown in with one lot or the other) - thank you for keeping things civil here, as well as doing your best to help a person new to all this inform himself.  Sometimes, from the outside looking in, the 'big-blocker vs. small-blocker' dispute seems a bit like the United Atheist Alliance going to war against the Allied Athiest Alliance, so I greatly appreciated the opportunity you have all given me to inform myself and come to my own evaluation of what is going on. So again, thank you.   I didn't expect a response quite this awesome, and I think the fact that there is so much here is a testament to how good this community really is. At this point, the thread has taken on a life of its own, and I feel that as bitcoin and cryptomarkets grow, this thread is going to help quite a few of us curious souls new to all this wandering in from the cold.  \n\nSo again, to everyone who took the time to contribute here, thank you, and may Satoshi him(her?)-self smile upon your good fortune.\n\nEdit 2: I would also just like to say two more quick things.  First, I hope you don't mind if I ask questions below to some of you in places where I am a bit unclear about things.  And second, I'm just going to preemptively reiterate: I am new to all this, and am not on any one 'side'; in my questions I may make statements as I attempt to clarify things for myself, and those statements may either be supporting or attacking your 'side', but that is only because I'm trying to understand, and not because I am actually on one 'side' or the other.",

I recently sold some of my Iota for Tron because I like Justin Sun & team and I feel like we'll see some big gains after the partnership announcements.\n\nBut seriously though some of you people sound like fucking morons or little kids. For real, everyone who's bitching in this sub must be new to crypto because everything Tron is facing right now is TOTALLY NORMAL. \n\nI was an early investor in Iota at $0.20 and guess what, after it hit $1.10 it dropped back down to below $0.50 for MONTHS before it went ham and is now sitting around $4. \n\nThe way some of you are acting just because of a ten cent drop and some FUD from nerds sitting in their mom's basement is ridiculous. Guess what happens when you break into the top ten in market cap? You start getting more attention which = more people spreading FUD, shitting on your coin etc etc..\n\nI'm reading so many small minded people trying to make yourself feel better by posting about why you sold it makes me sick. \n\nThe reality is this: There is gonna be soooooo much money coming into crypto in 2018 and it's only gonna get bigger. That means there's going to be a lot of different coins that see huge gains. \n\nWhether or not a crypto hang IMO comes down to a few things: The team, the partnerships (are businesses using the coin), and finally the media attention is finally what helps it blow up. Tron is really young and already has some good progress in all three areas. Top ten in market cap is no joke!!\n\nIt hasn't even been a week since Justin Sun talked about partnerships and we should see an announcement soon so go take a fucking xanax or get a pacifier or your fucking binkie, whatever you need to do and chill out.

Note that most is paraphrased as I watched, not direct quotes. Quotes in \"\". Sorry, was typed quickly so may be some spelling mistakes or unclear points (in which case watch the video).\n\n**Roadmap:**\nWorking on a public roadmap for the website with various projects & priorities, interactive and updated.\nWill have same format as the Trinity roadmap.\nComing soon.\n\n**IXI Hub:**\nLong overdue, going over it a number of times to ensure right, secure, to deal with billions of dollars in transactions.\nRefactoring the code, working with the exchanges.\nVery close to the point where Hub will be in the field.\n\n**Richard Soley:**\nHe will assist IOTA with setting up an alliance. May hand over parts of the IOTA Foundation (projects) to Eclipse Foundation.\n\n**Finance Partnerships:**\nInterest in expanding IOTA into regular finance, not just M2M.\nIn the future there is no distinction between M2M/IoT and regular finance.\n\n**Partners in Core Tech:**\nOutside contributors requires governance, which is in place for the Foundation, but no official governance in place to manage externally provided code.\nOpen to indsutry submitting ideas and code for a global standard.\n\n**Differences between IOTA in 2015 and now:**\nOn (almost) exact path that they set out to create, which is inevitable as they are pioneering the space (building the road).\nFurther ahead than they thought they would be.\nMarket cap, partners, etc exceeded expectations (at this early stage).\nRarely looking at how far they have come (bigger picture) as regularly looking to the next challenge.\n\n**Swarm nodes:**\nSwarm nodes on priority agenda for 2019.\nCfB working on the intricacies of enabling these.\nWon't need them until we see IoT adoption.\n\n**Transactions:**\nGoal to reach 1000 CTPS in 2018, prefer with organic adoption, rather than just under stress test.\n\n**Identity:**\nWorking on it since 2015 (& still actively), identity layer for IoT and humans.\nA fundamental building block for future projects.\nPurpose of IF is to enable and create the basic building blocks to enable the machine economy.\nHow can I trust a charging station is a charging station? Identity is everywhere & important.\nBlockchain (or Tangle) only a small part of an identity system (a mosaic used as a metaphor).\nHas to be a collaboration effort (across industry, not just one Foundation), not all projects have been disclosed.\nInternet of me, GDPR provides opportunity to hand over control of data to users for monetisation, etc.\n\n**How The Team Works:**\nThe future of work, collaboration across the globe.\nCompletely distributed, decentralised team, working 24/7.\nTone of Foundation much more friendly than a regular company.\nBootstrapping under the eye of the public.\nCreate a technology with this sort of impact is the opportunity of a life time.\nDealing with attacks is stressful, emotional, a distraction at times, but the team is dedicated and works through the night when needed.\nProductivity level in the team is beyond boundaries.\nEvery day there is new questions that can't be answered via Google or Stack Exchange, needing to invent solutions all the time and come up with new questions.\nNot one leader, everyone is contributing to the vision and ecosystem. All in the IF have same perspective, all about \"getting shit done\".\nIF in more than 15 countries, not just a German NFP.\nDavid and Dom thrive in chaos. Exciting to see how committed everyone is.\nAiming to have IF at 100+ people by the end of the year.\n\n**What Can Non-Techs Do To Contribute:**\nAnyone can add value if you spend some time doing \"something\".\nExample: Limo running the Tangle blog with Sunday YouTube rant, a valuable resource.\nAnswer questions on Reddit / Stack Exchange / GitHub.\nCreate blog posts, create content (content creators important for the ecosystem).\nSome companies working with IF have been connected by random people in the community who happen to work there.\nFind something that you can put energy into.\nA person who has never heard about blockchain needs to know about how IOTA can help them.\nMeetups are getting more important. Community can help to shape these, participate, innovate.\nHuge opportunities for people to pursue careers in IOTA (developers in the space can earn good coin, etc).\nDon't ask for permission to do something, \"just fucking do something\" :)\nImpressed by the ecosystem every single day, seeing new projects they haven't heard of provides IF energy to keep going.\n\n**FUD:**\nIOTA has been attacked over and over by idiots.\nIF are doing their best to create something new for the world.\nWhy the fuck is this happening?\nDon't care anymore, they will avoid getting distracted, forget about the naysayers.\nIn the real world (corporate world), they are not seeing any resistance, only enthusiasm.\nAll of the nonsense comes from other crypto projects or those with close ties to them.\nFocusing on real world adoption, all that matters.\nGetting better on focusing on work, getting shit done.\nTakes courage from the corporate partners (among the most conservative and largest in the world) to join IOTA, they are aware of the FUD from the crypto outlets.\nThe corporates want to work with IOTA, they ignore the FUD.\nThe FUD is beyond ridiculous. IF have to correct some of the lies, but the rest is ignored.\nIt's the ultimate compliment that others have to go out of their way to tarnish IOTA with complete fabrications.\n\n**Social Problems:**\nNext stage: want to apply the tech to true social problems.\nWant to partner with NGOs and other organisations e.g. tech to support refugees, unbanked, etc.\nNo specific ideology/neutral as a Foundation, not supporting left / right / centre politics. Just creating the voting mechanism.\n\n**Final:**\nThey miss regular contact with the community & want to host these regularly, perhaps monthly.\n\n** Video cutoff near the end as David was saying something **\n\nu/DavidSonstebo -> We want a picture of your cats!",

A real company with a roughly 9 billion dollar market cap, I might add:  https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/300431.SZ?p=300431.SZ\n\nWhatever other news we may hear, this is *huge* in showing Tron is a real company with a real project vetted by real partners of significant standing. \n\nThe market is crazy, and the FUD is thick, but now you can read it knowing at least the company is the real deal regardless what garbage people keep posting.\n\nHope that helps some of you get a good night's sleep.",

When I first saw it, I thought it was so helpful, I shared it with several friends and relatives who were interested in investing. The content seems great on the surface but it conceals a nasty scam.\n\nThe poster is user/WillRog79 and he does a great job of luring in users, only to steal their IOTA.\n\nHow Does He Do This?\nEmbedded in the extensive help is a link to a seed generator. On the surface the link looks totally legit; the human-readable text points to the ipfs.io/ipfs/... but the hypertext address that you get sent to has a different domain lpfs.io - did you notice the difference?\n\nThe correct link starts with the letter I while the bogus one starts with the letter L. In lowercase text, they're almost impossible to tell apart unless you look really closely.\n\nOur friend WillRog78 is even smart enough that if you enter the root scammer domain, it redirects to the valid one. It's only if you enter the full link that you get served a scamming web page that is a complete replica of the authentic seed generator.\n\nWithin hours of making a deposit using one of these seeds, your funds will be withdrawn and stolen from under your nose. All by someone posing as a \"helpful\" person out to assist the community. This post has been upvoted nearly 3,000 times so I can only imagine that hundreds of folks have used the site and many of these have had their funds stolen.\n\nMy young friend just had 3Gi stolen from his wallet because I shared the link to this so-called \"help manual\" - money he could ill afford to lose and I'm guessing that many of the folks reporting lost funds may also have been victims of this scam. \n\nPLEASE HELP TRACK THIS CROOK DOWN AND LET'S STOP OTHERS FROM HAVING THEIR MONEY STOLEN TOO.\n\nIt's criminal activities like this that make new investors scared to work with Iota. If anyone knows of a way to track the funds, please let me know. I have the bundle and hash info for the confirmed withdrawal if it would help.\n\nDON'T GET SCAMMED. BE SAFE OUT THERE.\n\nEDIT: The phishing link has been taken down and the link corrected to the correct domain. I still advise people not to trust online seed generators and to use an offline method such as KeePass2. Even then, I suggest manually editing 5-10 characters of the generated seed just to guarantee that there is no way your seed could be compromised.\n\nEDIT: I have changed the post so the link is no longer clickable. I also informed both Dom and David about this scam and received a thank you email back. No word from anyone if there's a way to \"follow the money\" trail and freeze the funds or to reimburse those who can prove that they were victims. If anyone has ideas about how we could trace these bastards and bring them to justice, please let me know. I don't even know which law enforcement agency would even have jurisdiction in a case like this.\n\n",

(honest question) As much as we hate on TRX, they've got a much more realistic system of issuing and burning coins, as do many other blockchains... I just don't see how Bitcoin will ever be a usable currency... Eth can at least be modified to address issues like this, Bitcoin seemingly can't be, just look at all the forks!"

The two options are:\n\na) BUILD with these tokens (spend them on community projects)\n\nb) BURN those tokens (lock them away so nobody will ever be able to use them)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Where do these 60 Ti come from?**\n\nMost of the tokens at stake were sold at IOTAs original crowd-sale in 2016, but were never claimed by their respective buyers. Others remain unclaimed since a network-transition in the beginnings of 2017. After five years of trying to find the owners the IOTA Foundation gave out a final deadline to claim these tokens, pledging to give the remaining ones into the hands of the IOTA community. This deadline passed and now it is onto you to decide about their future.\n\n**Who can vote?**\n\nAll IOTA token holders!\n\nYour voting weight will be determined by two factors:\n\n1. How many tokens do you use for this vote (100 MIOTA have 10-times more voting power than 10 MIOTA)\n2. How long do you not move your tokens during the voting period (probably about two weeks). Lower holding times will result in proportionally lower voting weight (for example, if two weeks will be defined as 100% voting weight, then holding them still for one week will result in 50% of voting weight).\n\n**!!Important!!**\n\n\u00b7 Voting is completely **for free** (no costs, no fees)\n\n\u00b7 Voting is completely **voluntary** (you will neither directly gain or lose anything by casting your vote).\n\n\u00b7 You will have **100% control of your tokens at all times** (tokens stay at your address)\n\n\u00b7 Your **tokens do not get locked** in this process (you can use them for something else at any time)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**How do I vote?**\n\nYou will be able to vote with your tokens **directly inside your official Firefly wallet** (supporting version will be released before the election, expected later this year). This version will have a completely new voting window with a clean design and a clear and easy user-interface (see mock-up pictures below as an example).\n\nIn case you vote, Firefly will send your tokens to your own address (this means they effectively don\u2019t move and they never leave your control). This transaction will carry your decision as a data-load. Your decision as well as your voting weight will be fully transparent on the IOTA Tangle. As every transaction on IOTA **your vote will be pseudonymous** (the address will be public, however your name or other personal information will never enter the network in any way).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The options: Build or Burn!**\n\n**Option A: BUILD**\n\nIf the majority of tokens votes for \u201cbuild\u201d, a decentralized form of organization (for example a DAO) will be set up by community members in order control these 60 Ti. This organization will be fully controlled by the IOTA community via token-weighted democracy or another system, that the community decides on. IOTA-focused projects that want to receive funds could be able to apply for payments according to rules that will be created and voted on by the community. Community-vote will always decide, if these funds are paid out.\n\nThis organization would be built under **democratic supervision** of the community: Important decisions will be up for vote about every 4-6 weeks within your Firefly wallet (participation is of course voluntary).\n\n**Option B: BURN**\n\nIf the majority of tokens vote to \u201cburn\u201d, no DAO will be build and instead all tokens in question will remain unmigrated into the current IOTA 1.5 (Chrysalis) network. This will irreversibly lock these tokens away, prohibiting anyone from ever using them again for any purpose.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Preliminary design of the new voting-windows in Firefly**\n\n**Vote proposal window**\n\nInside your voting menu you can see all ongoing votes regarding the IOTA treasury DAO. At the beginning you will only find the \"build or burn\" vote.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p8yrkj1uqvj71.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9e775be9582af1c640442e3d563beed66d1a5a7\n\n**Proposal details**\n\nIn the details page of any proposal you can find all important information about the vote that is to be decided on, including the exact meaning of both voting options. Here you will also find the buttons enabling you to cast your vote\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7jjcg5fvqvj71.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=29d51374659ee9624c2e65a1055a7df7e235aa0d\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Join the community efforts now!**\n\nThe IOTA treasury governance is a real grassroots development and thrives from community participation.

See [here] (https://www.reddit.com/r/Antshares/comments/6i0cj8/translated_article_062217_smart_economy_antshares/) and [here] (https://www.reddit.com/r/Antshares/comments/6hyfo9/translated_article_mobilego_to_join_antshares/). For those who don't, I am an early investor (~USD5) of Antshares and a Singaporean Chinese based out of Singapore.\n\nIt has come to my attention that there is mass hysterics going on around NEO and Chinese coins due to the recent articles surfacing and re-posted without much consideration. While I understand there is a language gap and information handicap for our western investors, it seems that the panic has reached a boiling point (where I need to explain countless times about the regulations). This so-called regulations' effects are actually not noticeable at all in the Wechat cryptocurrency groups I am in.\n\nLet's break down all these articles, shall we?\n\n**The Sauce of it all** \nhttp://finance.caixin.com/2017-09-04/101140069.html\nThe thinktank of this article is NIFA (\u4e2d\u56fd\u4e92\u8054\u7f51\u91d1\u878d\u534f\u4f1a\uff08NATIONAL INTERNET FINANCE ASSOCIATION OF CHINA\uff0c\u82f1\u6587\u7f29\u5199NIFA) that handles the studies of Internet financials which recommends considerations to the Central Government to ensure the financial stability of her citizens. In this article, they released an article 99 published this year which proclaims ICOs to be illegal money laundering, illegal funding and amongst other things, cheating. While we know of a lot scam ICOs, where is the article 99 they published?\n\nA quick look at Chinese Government [site] (http://www.gov.cn/zhengce/xxgkzl.htm) which releases these articles, there's no Article 99.\n\nSee exhibit: https://imgur.com/a/q716T\n\nBasically, this article has spread through different mediums and caused considerable damage to the community at large.\n\nNow let us go to something more credible and released not more than 2 hours ago. The People's Bank Of China (basically financial Big Brother) has just released a statement on cryptocurrency as a whole **in China**. \nSauce: http://www.pbc.gov.cn/goutongjiaoliu/113456/113469/3374222/index.html\n\nThe main points are:\n1. Token sales are not recognized by the PBC as an official channel of fund raising. As such, all cryptocurrency **trading** related activities are deemed as illegal until further notice.\n\n2. Upon this report, all persons or cooperations are to stop all activities involving token sales. Any token sales that are completed prior or ongoing to this report, the team is to make arrangements to return all amounts to the investors. Any offenders will be reprimanded by relevant department of the government.\n\n3. Upon this report, ALL cryptocurrency trading/ICO funding sites within China are to stop their operations till further notice. The relevant department of the government will stop ISPs from serving traffic to such sites should these remain operational despite this notice.\n\n4. All financial and non-banking companies are not to start ICO fund raising campaigns.\n\n5. Chinese investors are reminded to exercise caution when trading with cryptocurrency.\n\n6. All financial related companies are to understand the government strategy. \n\nNow, as what this report has said - All Cryptocurrency-related operations within China are to be stopped. If you have been paying attention to Chinese cryptocurrency space or Chinese ICOs, they already have heard of such news way before. That is why it is more operationally economical to stop their ICOs now than go through it and get slammed with this.\n\nWhat is not said in the article is by when. So there is a certain grace period for these CC firms in China to wind down their operations. \n\nIMHO, \n1. The Central Government is stepping in to establish rules and regulations surrounding ICOs and cryptocurrency trading. \n2. Cryptocurrency trading companies in China will be moving their operations overseas instead.\n3. Coins originating from China will be looking to get their coins listed on international exchanges.\n\nSo there you have it. A quick and dirty translation of what is important to you, as a NEO investor. As usual, this article is not financial advise. Please DYOR and due diligence.\n\nmeow.\n\nEdit: Can I be shameless and put my NEO/BTC wallet address here? If you feel this article has helped you in any way, please consider throwing a few coins to my catnip fund. :)\n\n\nNEO: AHgCYSpWbwJZdgCLVmB1RR6XxP8o411kSA\n\nBTC: 14uDBScUHU1gHwL41aGqYMCHa99EKnXe3Y\n",

        "post_body": "IOTA adoption is not awesome recently; not because it's a bad technology, but because some coins look more transparent and exciting in the short term, so the attention is moving there.\n\nThis annoys me because IOTA is bringing features that no other coin provide, and thus should be shielded against the regular FUD and repeated questions that don't get a clear answer.\n\nHere are IMO the main concerns to solve right now:\n\n**Address Reuse**\n\nNot being able to reuse an address is scary (feels like the coin is insecure) and prevent some use case. Having a roadmap item to address this problem with address aliases is enough to address the problem for now, but it's nowhere to be seen.\n\n**Full History Nodes**\n\nNot being able to setup a full-history node is a problem. I've been told to ask on Slack, but even there I never got an answer how to setup one (I already run a full node). Even if it's possible, it's clearly not an open and public process, and it's a requirement to be able to check all the history of transactions of a crypto coin, without having to ask permission from someone. There is no mention of this anywhere.\n\n**P2P Node Discovery**\n\nThe fact that you need to be in sync with 8 node owners on Slack to be able to run a full node is cumbersome, and those nodes are not stable so you need to constantly and manually find new people with new nodes to connect to. Manual peering is security through obscurity: This does not prevent anyone to run hundreds of malicious nodes (he just need 1 valid peer and put all his other nodes behind) and it's preventing IOTA to get lots of legit nodes. Anyone should be able to launch a full node without having to manually peer it: Bring back node discovery in the code.\n\n**Post Snapshot Zero Balance**\n\nBalance recovery after automatic snapshotting: How many people come on Reddit, Slack or the forum being scared to see zero balance: Let's have the GUI show a message telling the user to wait while transactions are being created until his balance is up to date. The current way is not gonna scale well if some people have to do 100+ transactions to get back their balance.\n\n**Slack**\n\nStop sending people to Slack to get answers to their question. People should be able to Google their answer, so answer their question on Reddit, on the forum or in the doc. An official Wiki or even an official documentation git repository on github with people able to submit pull requests would be enough. But Slack becomes more and more counterproductive everyday, especially since it's the default answer for the tougher questions: \"Ask the devs on Slack\": Devs have better to do, and most people won't bother and will move their attention to other coins.\n\n**TLDR;**\n\nHere we go. The past few weeks, I've mostly seen those question with a \"Ask on Slack\" or not a clear answer. If those questions were clearly answered on a \"semi official\" place, we could point people to those answers and make the coin look more serious. This is not about marketing, this is about a dev+community effort to clarify some plan.\n\nThat's my opinion, my \"guts\", I'm not scared about IOTA long term: I'm still bullish, but I feel we could do better as a community if we solved those.\n\nFeel free to point out other issues that you think hinder the adoption of IOTA: Unlike some people, I'm a holder that's not scared about the weak points of IOTA: I think we should put the light on those weaknesses and deal with them intelligently, under the spot light.",

With the simulated mining experience, people in impoverished nations will be able to receive money for free to a safe account (This is essentially a widespread test of Universal Basic Income, if you are unfamiliar look it up. Elon Musk is a huge supporter). If this goes viral in these countries, everyone will be using this currency as a means for daily transactions. This is important because most people view crypto an asset to invest, instead of a currency to buy things with. THIS IS HUGE. High transaction volume and widespread usage will increase the value of ETN greatly. \n\nIn my opinion, the marketing/advertising team should have a heavy focus on getting ETN to take off in impoverished nations. There the foundation for ETN will be created and will pave the path for ETN to be a major global currency. What are your thoughts?\n\nEdit: changed transaction rate to transaction volume",

Please focus discussion on IOTA technology, ecosystem announcements, project development, apps, etc. Please direct help questions to /r/IOTASupport, and price discussions and market talk to /r/IOTAmarkets.\n\nBefore getting started it is recommended to read the [IOTA_Whitepaper.pdf](https://iota.org/IOTA_Whitepaper.pdf). I also suggest watching these videos first to gain a better understanding.\n\n[IOTA BREAKDOWN: The Tangle Vs. Blockchain Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_jNH9BlEEo)\n\n[IOTA tutorial 1: What is IOTA and some terminology explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsaPA3U4ung)\n\n***\n#Information\n\n###Firstly, what is IOTA?\n>IOTA is an open-source distributed ledger protocol launched in 2015 that goes 'beyond blockchain' through its core invention of the blockless \u2018Tangle\u2019. The IOTA Tangle is a quantum-resistant Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), whose digital currency 'iota' has a fixed money supply with zero inflationary cost.\n\n>IOTA uniquely offers zero-fee transactions & no fixed limit on how many transactions can be confirmed per second. Scaling limitations have been removed, since throughput grows in conjunction with activity; the more activity, the more transactions can be processed & the faster the network. Further, unlike blockchain architecture, IOTA has no separation between users and validators (miners / stakers); rather, validation is an intrinsic property of using the ledger, thus avoiding centralization.\n\n>IOTA is focused on being useful for the emerging machine-to-machine (m2m) economy of the Internet-of-Things (IoT), data integrity, micro-/nano- payments, and other applications where a scalable decentralized system is warranted.\n\nMore information can be found [here](https://iota.readme.io/docs/what-is-iota).\n\n###Seeds\nA seed is a unique identifier that can be described as a combined username and password that grants you access to your IOTA.\n\nYour seed is used to generate the addresses and private keys you will use to store and send IOTA, so this should be kept private and not shared with anyone. If anyone obtains your seed, they can generate the private keys associated with your addresses and access your IOTA.\n\n###Non reusable addresses\nContrary to traditional blockchain based systems such as Bitcoin, where your wallet addresses can be reused, IOTA's addresses should only be used once (for outgoing transfers). That means there is no limit to the number of transactions an address can receive, but as soon as you've used funds from that address to make a transaction, this address should not be used anymore.\n\n**Why?**\n\nWhen an address is used to make an outgoing transaction, a random 50% of the private key of that particular address is revealed in the transaction signature, which effectively reduces the security of the key. A typical IOTA private key of 81-trits has 27^81 possible combinations ( 8.7 x 10^115 ) but after a single use, this number drops to around 27^54 ( 2 x 10^77 ), which coincidentally is close to the number of combinations of a 256-bit Bitcoin private key. Hence, after a single use an IOTA private key has about the same level of security as that of Bitcoin and is basically impractical to brute-force using modern technology. However, after a second use, another random 50% of the private key is revealed and the number of combinations that an attacker has to guess decreases very sharply to approximately 1.5^54 (~3 billion) which makes brute-forcing trivial even with an average computer.\n\nNote: your seed is never revealed at at time; only private keys specific to each address.\n\n**The current light wallet prevents address reuse automatically for you by doing 2 things:**\n\n1. Whenever you make an outgoing transaction from an address that does not consume its entire balance (e.g. address holds 10 Mi but you send only 5 Mi), the wallet automatically creates a new address and sends the change (5 Mi) to the new address.\n\n2. The wallet prevents you from performing a second outgoing transaction using the same address (it will display a \u201cPrivate key reuse detected!\u201d error).\n\nThis piggy bank diagram can help visualize non reusable addresses. [imgur link](https://i.imgur.com/3oejD6v.jpg)\n\n[Insert new Safe analogy].\n\n###Address Index\nWhen a new address is generated it is calculated from the combination of a seed + Address Index, where the Address Index can be any positive Integer (including \"0\"). The wallet usually starts from Address Index 0, but it will skip any Address Index where it sees that the corresponding address has already been attached to the tangle.\n\n###Private Keys\nPrivate keys are derived from a seeds key index. From that private key you then generate an address. The key index starting at 0, can be incremented to get a new private key, and thus address.\n\n**It is important to keep in mind that all security-sensitive functions are implemented client side.** What this means is that you can generate private keys and addresses securely in the browser, or on an offline computer. All libraries provide this functionality.\n\nIOTA uses winternitz one-time signatures, as such you should ensure that you know which private key (and which address) has already been used in order to not reuse it. **Subsequently reusing private keys can lead to the loss of funds (an attacker is able to forge the signature after continuous reuse).**\n\nExchanges are advised to store seeds, not private keys.\n\n***\n\n#FAQ\n\n##Buying IOTA\n\n###How do I to buy IOTA?\nCurrently not all exchanges support IOTA and those that do may not support the option to buy with fiat currencies.\n\nVisit this website for a Guide: [How to buy IOTA](https://howtobuyiota.co.uk/)\n\nor [Click Here for a detailed guide made by /u/450LbsGorilla](https://www.reddit.com/r/Iota/comments/7jbohf/i_was_tired_of_seeing_people_ask_this_question/)\n\n###Cheapest way to buy IOTA?\nYou can track the current cheapest way to buy IOTA at [IOTA Prices](https://iotaprices.com/).\n\nIt tells you where & how to get the most IOTA for your money right now. There's an overview of the exchanges available to you and a buying guide to help you along.\n\nIOTAPrices.com monitors all major fiat exchanges for their BTC & ETH rates and combines them with current IOTA rates from IOTA exchanges for easy comparison. Rates are taken directly from each exchange's official websocket. For fiat exchanges or exchanges that don't offer websockets, rates are refreshed every 60 seconds.\n\n###What is MIOTA?\nMIOTA is a unit of IOTA, 1 Mega IOTA or 1 Mi. It is equivalent to 1,000,000 IOTA and is the unit which is currently exchanged.\n\nWe can use the metric prefixes when describing IOTA e.g 2,500,000,000 i is equivalent to 2.5 Gi.\n\nNote: some exchanges will display IOTA when they mean MIOTA.\n###Can I mine IOTA?\nNo you can not mine IOTA, all the supply of IOTA exist now and no more can be made. \n\nIf you want to send IOTA, your 'fee' is you have to verify 2 other transactions, thereby acting like a miner/node.\n\n***\n##Storing IOTA\n\n###Where should I store IOTA?\nIt is not recommended to store large amounts of IOTA on the exchange as you will not have access to the private keys of the addresses generated.\n\n####Wallets\n\n**GUI Desktop (Full Node + Light Node)**\n\n>Version = 2.5.6\n\n>Download: [GUI v2.5.6](https://github.com/iotaledger/wallet/releases/tag/v2.5.6)\n\n>Guide: [Download/Login Guide](https://matthewwinstonjohnson.gitbooks.io/iota-guide-and-faq/getting-started/dl-wallet.html)\n\n>Nodes: [Status](https://iota.dance/nodes)\n\n**Headless IRI (Full Node)**\n\n>Version = 1.4.1.4\n\n>Download: [Mainnet v1.4.1.4](https://github.com/iotaledger/iri/releases/tag/v1.4.1.4)\n\n>Guide:\n\n>Find Neighbours: /r/nodesharing\n\n**UCL Desktop/Android/iOS (Light Node)**\n\n>Version = Private Alpha Testing\n\n>Website: [iota-ucl (Medium)](https://medium.com/iota-ucl)\n\n**Android (Light Node)**\n\n> Version = Beta\n\n> Download: [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.iota.wallet)\n\n**iOS (Light Node)**\n\n> Version = Beta Testing\n\n> Website: [https://iota.tools/wallet](https://iota.tools/wallet) \n\n\n**Paper Wallet**\n\n> Version = v1.3.6\n\n> Repo: [GitHub](https://github.com/arancauchi/IOTA-Paper-Wallet)\n\n**Seed Vault**\n\n> Version = v1.0.2\n\n> Repo: [GitHub7](https://github.com/jonassix/IotaSeedVault/)\n\n\n###What is a seed?\nA seed is a unique identifier that can be described as a combined username and password that grants you access to your wallet.\n\nYour seed is used to generate the addresses linked to your account and so this should be kept private and not shared with anyone. If anyone obtains your seed, they can login and access your IOTA.\n\n###How do I generate a seed?\nYou must generate a random 81 character seed using only A-Z and the number 9.\n\nIt is recommended to use offline methods to generate a seed, and not recommended to use any non community verified techniques. To generate a seed you could:\n\n####On a Linux Terminal\n use the following command:\n\n        cat /dev/urandom |tr -dc A-Z9|head -c${1:-81}\n\n####On a Mac Terminal\n use the following command:\n\n        cat /dev/urandom |LC_ALL=C tr -dc 'A-Z9' | fold -w 81 | head -n 1\n\n####With KeePass on PC\nA helpful guide for generating a secure seed on KeePass can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1b4dpnC6VWTQ3N7JHVU3SwYmwL_dt-QRD/view).\n\n####With a dice\n[Dice roll template](https://www.reddit.com/r/Iota/comments/7hos4t/secure_dice_roll_seed_generator_template/)\n\n###Is my seed secure?\n 1. All seeds should be 81 characters in random order composed of A-Z and 9.\n 2. Do not give your seed to anyone, and don\u2019t keep it saved in a plain text document. \n 3. Don\u2019t input your seed into any websites that you don\u2019t trust.\n\n[Is Someone Going To Guess My IOTA Seed?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8YIdmwcubc)\n\nWhat are the odds of someone guessing your seed?\n\n * IOTA seed = 81 characters long, and you can use A-Z, 9\n * Giving 27^81 = 8.7x10^115 possible combinations for IOTA seeds\n * Now let's say you have a \"super computer\" letting you generate and read every address associated with 1 trillion different seeds per second.\n * 8.7x10^115 seeds / 1x10^12 generated per second = 8.7x10^103 seconds = 2.8x10^96 years to process all IOTA seeds.\n\n###Why does balance appear to be 0 after a snapshot?\nWhen a snapshot happens, all transactions are being deleted from the Tangle, leaving only the record of how many IOTA are owned by each address. However, the next time the wallet scans the Tangle to look for used addresses, the transactions will be gone because of the snapshot and the wallet will not know anymore that an address belongs to it. This is the reason for the need to regenerate addresses, so that the wallet can check the balance of each address. The more transactions were made before a snapshot, the further away the balance moves from address index 0 and the more addresses have to be (re-) generated after the snapshot.\n\n###What happens if you reuse an address?\nIt is important to understand that only outgoing transactions reveal the private key and incoming transactions do not. If you somehow manage to receive iotas using an address after having used it previously to send iotas\u2014let's say your friend sends iotas to an old address of yours\u2014these iotas may be at risk.\n\nRecall that after a single use an iota address still has the equivalent of 256-bit security (like Bitcoin) so technically, the iotas will still be safe if you do not try to send them out. However, you would want to move these iotas out eventually and the moment you try to send them out, your private key will be revealed a second time and it now becomes feasible for an attacker to brute-force the private key. If someone is monitoring your address and spots a second use, they can easily crack the key and then use it to make a second transaction that will compete with yours. It then becomes a race to see whose transaction gets confirmed first.\n\nNote: The current wallet prevents you from reusing an address to make a second transaction so any iotas you receive with a 'used' address will be stuck. This is a feature of wallet and has nothing to do with the fundamental workings of IOTA.\n\n***\n##Sending IOTA\n\n###What does attach to the tangle mean?\nThe process of making an transaction can be divided into two main steps:\n\n1. The local signing of a transaction, for which your seed is required.\n2. Taking the prepared transaction data, choosing two transactions from the tangle and doing the POW. This step is also called \u201cattaching\u201d.\n\nThe following analogy makes it easier to understand:\n> \n> Step one is like writing a letter. You take a piece of paper, write some information on it, sign it at the bottom with your signature to authenticate that it was indeed you who wrote it, put it in an envelope and then write the recipient's address on it. \n> \n> Step two: In order to attach our \u201cletter\u201d (transaction), we go to the tangle, pick randomly two of the newest \u201cletters\u201d and tie a connection between our \u201cletter\u201d and each of the \u201cletters\u201d we choose to reference. \n\nThe \u201cAttach address\u201d function in the wallet is actually doing nothing else than making an 0 value transaction to the address that is being attached.\n\n###Why is my transaction pending?\nIOTA's current Tangle implementation (IOTA is in constant development, so this may change in the future) has a confirmation rate that is ~66% at first attempt.\n\nSo, if a transaction does not confirm within 1 hour, it is necessary to \"reattach\" (also known as \"replay\") the transaction one time. Doing so one time increases probability of confirmation from ~66% to ~89%.\n\nRepeating the process a second time increases the probability from ~89% to ~99.9%.\n\n### How do I reattach a transaction.\nReattaching a transaction is different depending on where you send your transaction from. To reattach using the GUI Desktop wallet follow these steps:\n\n1. Click 'History'.\n2. Click 'Show Bundle' on the 'pending' transaction.\n3. Click 'Reattach'.\n4. Click 'Rebroadcast'. (optional, usually not required)\n5. Wait 1 Hour.\n6. If still 'pending', repeat steps 1-5 once more.\n\n###Does the private key get revealed each time you reattach a transaction?\nWhen you use the reattach function in the desktop wallet, a new transaction will be created but it will have the same signature as the original transaction and hence, your private key will not revealed a second time.\n\n###What happens to pending transactions after a snapshot?\n\n***\n##IOTA Network and Nodes\n\n###What incentives are there for running a full node?\nIOTA is made for m2m economy, once wide spread adoption by businesses and the IOT, there will be a lot of investment by these businesses to support the IOTA network. In the meantime if you would like to help the network and speed up p2p transactions at your own cost, you can support the IOTA network by setting up a Full Node.\n\n**Running a full node also means you don't have to trust a 3rd party light node provider.**  By running a full node you get to take advantage of new features that might not be installed on 3rd party nodes.\n\n###How to set up a full node?\nTo set up a full node you will need to follow these steps:\n\n1.

I'm on that list of \"HUGE WINS\" a couple of times.  I should have quit there, while substantially ahead of my starting amount, but the rush and greed got me in the end.  This is easy!  I'm going to get to 10,000 EOS at this rate!\n\nOut of all those transactions, I once rolled 11 wins in a row.  Twice, I rolled 12 losses in a row.  Calculating the probability and knowing how small of a chance of these events could occur (<1%), I figured it couldn't happen, could it?  Well, two runs of 12 consecutive losses wiped me out by 73%.  I should have stopped after the first major loss but no, it was just a matter of time before I'd win it back. <smh>\n\nThe strange thing is, before this game, I've never really gambled in any substantial manner.  I've bought a lottery ticket when the payout is several million, spent $20 at a casino a couple of times, but the ease of which I could spend EOS really got me.\n\nI'm not blaming anyone but my lack of self-control. This Saturday has been a complete wreck for me and I have become physically ill.  It even crossed my mind to try again but I decided on this reddit post instead.  Now I just have to hope EOS increases in value to cover my initial fiat deposit and hope that the BET Dividends are a real thing because, boy, do I now have a lot of BET Tokens!\n\n**SET A LIMIT, STAY WITHIN IN!**",

That number is of particular strategic importance in a landgrab industy like crypto.  \n\nIt represents the amount of funding Dash is winning in order to go into its next battle.  Once this landgrab phase slows down, each cryptocurrency will be fighting viciously to speak louder about the advantages it offers to consumers.  Getting larger reach now means more power going into the next stage of advancement.  We can measure our reach by our marketshare percentage, which currently stands at 1.09%.  \n\nWhile watching Dash's price rise in fiat dollar terms is fun, it's like comparing the beauty of a 25 year old woman to that of an 85 year old grandma who is far past her prime.  Fiat is on its deathbed, and Dash needs to be looking at how it stacks up against people its own age.  Dash is the best product, and it deserves to be shaking hands with Bitcoin at #2.  \n\nOnce Dash develops a system for the efficient deployment of its massive monthly treasury, that 1.09% will climb every week, and every month.  It will happen like clockwork.\n\nWe'll use that increased market share once it's time to get retail users using Evolution.  \n\nAs many of you know, I have backed and act as official advisor to the team at [DashTreasury.org](http://www.DashTreasury.org).  **I believe it is with this effort, and the complete coordination of MNOs, that we can begin to feel the effect of what a $1M/mo budget can do.**  For me, as a veteran marketer and business owner, if I'm not seeing substantial marketshare growth every single month, I am failing.

If Decred attracts too many passive \"investors\" looking for \"passive income\" this will end bad.\n\n>  Today the yield is over 10% in USD terms at $120 ticket price and 48% of tokens staked on the network. Even as ticket prices approach the absolute limit of USD$195, which happens at 100% staking pool participation, then the staking yield will still remain above ~ 6.5% in USD terms.\n\nPoS yield is denominated in DCR. Tickets are about 120 DCR now.\n\n> I can't understand why Tezos would have a market cap 4x the size of Decred\n\nBecause it has good business and media connections, because it raised hundreds of millions of dollars in exchange for promise, made a lot of noise in the media, is founded by ex bankers and HFT traders, etc.\n\nNote that Tezos is very different. It aims in the smart contracts domain and the killer feature is correct, verifiable contracts. I believe its tech is great but don't see why it needs its own token. Decred aims to be store of value and medium of exchange - \"just\" money done right.\n\n195 DCR is not \"absolute limit\" for ticket price. It was calculated for supply of 8 million DCR. The maximum possible ticket price is ~512 DCR assuming all 21M DCR is mined and staked, but this is unrealistic. For a more realistic figure let's take some 12M DCR (will be mined in mid 2020 per [this projection](https://docs.decred.org/advanced/inflation/)), assume 50% of that locked in PoS and divide by the target 40,960 tickets => 146 DCR."

        "post_body": "Hi All,\n\nThe recent announcement of adding Zcash to Cake Wallet has brought out very passionate voices against this move and some supporting it.  Honestly, we are humbled by how much passion is there in the monero world for Cake Wallet.  It\u2019s great to know that people are as passionate about Cake as the Cake Wallet team is.\n\nSome history: As some of you remember, Cake was built in a vacuum in 2017 funded fully by the founder and launched in 2018.  But after the launch, we became fully involved in the community and even took guidance from the community to open source the app.  Throughout the years, we have listened to the community on various things like what exchanges to add, or even what coins to add, etc.  Also since launch, we have been involved in many facets of the Monero world including donating to the dev fund, CCSs, related projects, competing projects, conferences, shows/podcasts, and much more.\n\nWhen we added BTC and LTC most monero folks didn\u2019t have a problem as these coins don\u2019t proclaim themselves to be privacy coins.  That brings us to Zcash and we can see how some might have problem with us adding it.  We have always worked with the community and now also have heard you loud and clear.\n\nBased on feedback, the following is the plan for Cake Technologies:\n\n* Drop everything and prioritize the Monero only app.  BTW, we have ALWAYS wanted to do a Monero only app for the hardcore folks. Our goal is to have this out by the end of the year and it will be available on Android and iOS.  It will still feature the exchanges and ultimately the buying of Monero through credit/debit cards.\n* Cake Wallet the current app will remain as it is now but may consider additional coins (like Ethereum or a stable coin or wownero) in the future.  Nothing will happen until we finish Monero only app.\n* For zcash, we will build a new and separate app.\n\nAgain we thank you all for the constructive feedback.   The above is not going to satisfy everyone as no plan is perfect, but the above plan does put Monero first.  Thank you all for reading.\n\nThe Cake Wallet Team\n\n[https://cakewallet.com](https://cakewallet.com)",

        "post_body": "My wife and I are having some work done on our new home. Our contractor agreed to give us a little discount if we agreed to pay in cash. I know he probably isn\u2019t going to report this income on his taxes, but honestly that is his problem, not mine - and it\u2019s not the point of this post.\n\nAll I need to do is pull out $5,000 to pay the contractor. My wife and I keep separate bank accounts, it just what we\u2019ve always done. As it turns out, the closest branch of my bank is almost 2 hours away from our new home. \n\nSo at first I though, I\u2019ll just wire her the money and she can take it out at her bank (which is less than 1 mile away). Turns out, there is a $50 fee to send her money electronically so I just wrote her a check and she cashed it on her phone. It took 3 days for the check to clear.\n\nWhen the check cleared, my wife drove over to the bank where she learned that her bank ONLY ALLOWS YOU TO WITHDRAW UP TO $2,000/DAY IN CASH! On top of that, the teller had to make a call to get clearance to withdraw the cash, and the whole process took about 35 minutes.\n\nAt their ATM, my wife can withdraw up to $1,000/day. Which means she\u2019ll have to head back the next day, and wait another 35 minutes just to get the full $5000 in cash for us to pay the contractor.\n\nIt takes 5 days, and asking permission from the bank to access our money. If the contractor had accepted crypto, that would have taken less than a few seconds.\n\nHow is it that people feel as though crypto is some sort of Ponzi scheme when the bank acts as though our money is really theirs? I know their rationale is that if everyone decided to pull their money out of a cryptocurrency all at once the whole system would collapse and it would all be worth nothing. But, the same exact thing goes with regular, old cash too.\n\nFor nothing more than a slight sense of security, banks have taken everything that we own and use it to enrich themselves. The use our money to issue loans, process transactions, and line their CEOs pockets with stock.\n\nI guess what I\u2019m saying is that maybe it\u2019s time we all collectively changed the way we store the value we earn for the work we do. It is time that we decide where our money goes, how it is used, and how it can be accessed when we need it. More importantly, it is time we started seeing the profits from our savings rather than it sit in a vault that we need permission to access.\n\nRant over. Thanks for listening.",

        "post_body": "EDIT: A good way to show you what I mean is to look at the past month of Ripple: https://imgur.com/ZfdvCTG\n\nEDIT: Soo hopefully you all listened because it's already climbing back up!\n\nIf you are new to Ripple you probably got all excited about the price increase but are freaking out about the dip. I on the other hand am very excited about it! Big dips are always followed by huge price surges. Look at Bitcoin or Ethereum or Litecoin. Here's why Ripple dipped....\n\n1) A lot of people set up automatic calls to sell Ripple when it reached .29 and .30. So as it quickly climbed, it slowed down at this \"peak\" because lots of people wanted to sell.\n\n2) Now that the price has dropped, all these same people go in and buy MORE Ripple. Which means the price will rise again.\n\n3) Now that it's reached .30 before, you'll start seeing automatic sells at .35 or .40. Which means soon we'll be hitting new highs again!\n\n4) Then guess what, it'll regroup after that as well. Just imagine someone climbing a mountain. You don't just run to the top your first try. You climb a little, take a break, climb a little, etc. \n\n5) BUT if you are smart and notice, all these prices are still continuing to go up overall. Ripple was only worth $.18 less than a month ago!! If you look at the big picture Ripple is climbing at an incredible rate.\n\n6) Anyways, just remember, majority of people try to sell high and buy low. We just saw Ripple hit a recent high so people sold. Now people are going to buy now that it's cheaper. And guess what, it's going to go up again. So BE SMART and ride the waves. \n\n7) My favorite time to buy any currency is when there is panic and the graphs are all red and things look terrible. Because then when they become green and happy I own way more currency and get to rub it in everyone's faces.\n\nBut for real, if you are smart just keep buying Ripple during the price dips and HOLD. In 2018 when it touches $1, you will have cared less about all these price dips and swings.\n\nInvest in the idea of Ripple, not in the arbitrary numbers you see on graphs with red and green lines.\n\nI too have made this mistake with other currencies when I first started, but now that I use logic and not emotion I've made a hell of a lot more money.\n\nEDIT: Already looks like it's starting to regroup again. I hope you new people listened up!",

        "post_body": "So, long story short, I started trading a year ago, been margin longing the whole run from 1k to 19k ( sometimes closing the top, sometimes closing too early or too late, but always making profit)\n\nI turned 3 lowly btc which I had from playing poker (at the time 3k) into nearly 200 BTC which was almost 4 million at the top and would be 2 million at current prices. \n\nI thought I was a trading genius, a god, whatever. Anyway, this is where the sadness starts.\n\nAfter the dump from 19k to 11k I went long at the bottom, and kept adding to my position on the bounce to 12k 13k, 14k. Then, at the 16k dead cat, my position was a further 100 BTC in profit. Instead of closing then and having a total 300 BTC, I increased leverage and increased my position size. This entire position was liquadated on the drop back to 12k, because my entry had moved up so much. I lost 100 btc paper profit and nearly 50 BTC margin. I was devasted, and down to 150 BTC total.\n\nAfter evaluating the situation, I came to the conclusion that the pump to 16k was a dead cat and that we are going lower. Therefore I shorted. At 12k. Added at 13k. Added at 14 and 15k. Got liquidated at the top at 17k. Another 50 BTC loss. Down to 100.\n\nThink, ok we made a higher high at 17k, uptrend back on. Went long. Got liquidated at 13k.\n\n50 BTC left. Devastated, unsure, no clue whats going on. Sat through the drop to 9k, when we bounced I thought it could be the bottom. Longed at 11500, panic closed 10500. When we went to 13k I was kicking myself for panic closing, went long at 12800.\n\nLiquidated this morning for my last bitcoin.\n\n3 BTC to 200, to 0\n\nAt this time I am still in shock, the last few months Ive neglected relationships and school, and Ive been daydreaming about living the high life rich as fuck with my millions.\n\nNow, I am nowhere.\n\nPosting this so others dont gamble away life changing money. Dont want donations or tips not posting an address dont PM me. I never want to hear the word btc again because I want to forget",

We have gained over 13,000 subscribers in just under 3 months and continue to grow as the days go on. \n\n\nToday, we are pleased to announce the release of an **optimized GUI wallet** which will allow users to send and receive Electroneum easier. We believe this will help our community on a large scale level and ensure that people are focused more towards securing their Electroneum, offline. \nWe are currently ready for a Beta release to approximately 100 users. Please note: The app functionality works great but we have not yet focused on the final design layout. This beta will ensure that functionality works on both ends and users can access, send and receive ETN with no issues. \n\n\n**The final product will be released in approximately 1 month, once Beta testing is complete.** \n\nPlease stay tuned to this sub-reddit for further details on how to be part of the Beta. We will post screen shots of the wallet once we have determined the date of the beta release. Thanks for all the support and we're looking forward to helping Electroneum grow. \n\nPlease note that this is a community created gui wallet. We are not directly affiliated with the Electroneum team, however we are the main source for their community with respect to Facebook, Twitter and Telegram.",

        "post_body": "Don't get me wrong. i fully believe in NEM and it's my main investment, but i see the amateur branding signs all over the place.\n\nExhibit A: Mosaics. the reason for calling them Mosaics, as per NEM, is because:\n\n>\"Some call it a colored coin while others may call it a token. We call it a mosaic that will take on many types of properties when it is full blown (hence we call it a mosaic as it evolves to form the \u201cbig picture\u201d) .\"\n\nNo, NEM, that is not a good reason. it's a confusing name that has no inherent reference to their function and that is why one of the most common topics on this subreddit is \"WTH is Mosaic?\". \n\nGive up the romantic naming a go and concentrate on simple, straightforward explanatory terms. you have a wonderful Token creation system. there are ICOs that raise millions offering exactly that and you already have it for years now, you've got 800K visits a month yet  i never see \"Hey, that ICO isn't offering anything new, NEM already got it!\". these are people that probably visited your webpage, but left it without knowing you've got it.\n\nPlease, don't take this little advice from some anonymous redditor as set in stone, just try it for one month and revert if it fails. Ctrl H, change Mosaic to **\"Smart Tokens\"**. that's it. with everything you got planned for them, a \"Smart Token\" is the perfect description. it sounds impressive, it describes their function and everybody can gouge what they probably are just by seeing their name.\n\nSide note: Look at what Bancor are doing with their smart tokens and steal it as an addition to yours. without a single shred of shame. good artists copy, great artists steal. \n\nExhibit B: NIS. for the love of god, why use these acronyms without even explaining what they are on your main webpage?! here's how it should look in your homepage: NIS - Decentralized Web Server. that's it. you got to keep that acronym (although i personally think it isn't needed on the main page) AND anyone glancing at it immediately understands what that is. don't hide features/functions behind tool tips or acronyms. \n\nExhibit C: Lightwallet. Honestly, there's isn't a problem with the naming here, per se, but the problem is that the immediate function that comes to mind from seeing it is: \"a simple wallet for people who want to buy, hold and transfer XEM.\" Why? because the bits about it \n>\"enables any merchant to easily incorporate the lightwallet javascript code into their websites to facilitate payments.\"  \n\nare buried at the back.  \n\nYou've built a JS \"wallet\"/snippet anyone can effortlessly embed in their App, Store or Webpage as a payment widget/front. ADVERTISE IT ON THE FRONT PAGE. not as the last comment on the tooltip for \"Lightwallet\". \n\nAnd btw, how is that \n>\"Every NIS serves the lightwallet via port 7777 but if connecting to any node other than a trusted one, it is recommended to run a standalone lightwallet version for full security.\"  \n\neven relevant there? put it under the lightwallet or downloads section but it has no place on the tooltip on the main page.\n\nThere are **many** more examples/issues but these were the ones that really bothered me.",

It makes the odds that the market will recover and continue to grow extremely likely.\n\nWhat would have been much more scary is if we had not hit this dip.

This means staking to CPU is no more \"working\" (It is still active, but highly inefficient). From now on, there is like in ETH, a transaction fee you have to pay for each transaction.  \n\n\nRead more about all your options: [https://help.eossupport.io/en/articles/5599328-cpu-or-net-issues](https://help.eossupport.io/en/articles/5599328-cpu-or-net-issues)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**How to get returns on EOS?**\n\nQ: How does staking work?\n\nA: Read more here: [https://help.eossupport.io/en/collections/3054104-new-to-eos-start-here#use-your-eos](https://help.eossupport.io/en/collections/3054104-new-to-eos-start-here#use-your-eos)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Active and Owner keypair / permission**\n\nQ: What is active and owner keypair?

We've been in touch with their team to offer help, they have assured us they are on top of it and are working to resolve the problem at their end. You can see their ETN status page here: https://www.cryptopia.co.nz/CoinInfo/?coin=ETN (at the time of writing ETN still has \"maintenance\" on it).\n\nWe have been assured by two big exchanges that our listing is \"imminent\". We are also in the queue and have paid listing fees for other exchanges, (we are under NDA and can't announce their names yet).\n\nWe very keen to ramp up our exchange listings and are applying for every exchange that we are not already in discussion with.\n\nCryptopia Alternatives\n\nIf you would like to use an exchange that is regulated by the Japanese Financial Services Authority and has been growing fast, then I'd recommend Qryptos.  You'll find some other exchange options on our website at https://electroneum.com/exchanges/\n\nHow you can help\n\nWe would love our community to help with our exchange listings. We have an enormous, and passionate community. If we could ask you to POLITELY ask your favourite exchanges via their social media and Telegram groups that you'd like to see ETN listed, then they'll understand how much demand there is to trade.\n\nThere are various petition campaigns running at https://www.change.org/search?q=electroneum that you could sign to show your support for listing. We can leverage these petitions at these larger exchanges and show the user numbers and demand there is for Electroneum.\n\nCryptopia has a Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/cryptopiaexchange that you could politely ask how long the ETN maintenance period will last for. Again, I'm sure they are working as hard as they can, but it can't hurt to show what huge demand there is for the problem to be resolved. \n\nIf every holder of ETN spends just 5 minutes of their time per week making social media posts to exchanges and petitions we can show the enormous power of the Electroneum community. We have nearly one MILLION registered users now!\n\nHave a great weekend!\n\nRichard Ells\nElectroneum Founder",

        "post_body": "&#x200B;\n\n[Tipping Dash builds camaraderie, and attracts newcomers to the world of digital cash.](https://preview.redd.it/m7k5k8p15go11.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7c42037fd3b10fa1f52c85bc054de0b514b0dd99)\n\n**Hi Dash Nation,**\n\nI have been helping /u/DeltaEngine to refine the tipbot for Reddit. I'm happy to say that after running some tests with the bot here and in other subreddits, the tipbot is ready for some serious use. And serious use is what I'm proposing.\n\nWe have an opportunity here to create a hotbed of cryptocurrency activity. The impression that we make on anyone who visits us is important. Being respectful and engaging in factual discourse is great, but there is a way to kick up the ambiance a notch. As anyone who visited r/dogecoin can attest, the fun you can have while tipping even small amounts is contagious.In addition, the added benefit is making this sub busier, more conversation, becoming sort of a mini-Steemit, where people's contributions are met with an introduction to the world of Dash through the tipbot. This is a great thing when you're goal is to spread adoption. We've got to get Dash into as many people's wallets as possible, and we can have a blast while doing it.\n\n**So, my challenge to you, Dash Nation, is grab an account with the tipbot, and start rewarding top quality comments when you see 'em, not just here, but when you see 'em on other subs as well.**\n\nThe more people that do this, the better. Let's make r/dogecoin look like amateurs! (No offense, r/dogecoin, lol)\n\n**Guide to get started with the challenge:**\n\n* Get a Reddit /u/MyDashWallet account by clicking on it's username, send it a private message with \"deposit\" on the subject line, and \u201cdeposit\u201d in the body of the post.\n* Send it to the bot.\n* You will get a response with an address for depositing Dash. Also, you will get a link to maintain your account on [mydashwallet.org](https://mydashwallet.org).\n* Send Dash to the address that the bot gives you. You are now ready to tip.\n\n**Guide how to tip:**\n\n* Identify a user/post that you think deserves a big fat tip, or a new user that is curious about Dash.\n* Reply to the post with **\"**/u/MyDashWallet **tip \\[AMOUNT\\]\"** Ex. /u/MyDashWallet tip 1 mDash\n* Note: After this initial mandatory message (*must be in that order*) you can write anything else you want to say to the poster you're replying to such as \"/u/MyDashWallet tip 1 mDash for that fantastic writeup\" or \"/u/MyDashWallet tip 1 mDash to get you started in your digital cash journey\"\n* The bot will respond in a few seconds and send the tip!\n* Added benefit: Users that you tip will automatically have their own Dash accounts set up!\n* Enjoy the feeling of spreading cheer.\n\nThat's a quick primer, but for those who would like to get more in-depth with it, please visit [https://mydashwallet.org/](https://mydashwallet.org/) for more information, or contact /u/DeltaEngine.\n\n**We can make this sub something else if we all get behind this, Dash Nation. What say you?**\n\nOnwards and upwards,\n\nTao Of Satoshi\n\nDash Nation Founder and Dash Forums Moderator",

With Bitcoin halving less than 100 days away and the potential for a Bitcoin ETF on the horizon, the stage is set for some thrilling developments.\n\nI've been diving deep into various projects, and I wanted to share my perspective on what could be the blue chips for the upcoming bull run.\n\nReal estate projects like [Parcl](https://app.parcl.co/) caught my attention. The intersection of crypto and real estate has incredible potential, and Parcl seems to be paving the way for innovative solutions.\n\nPost-quantum cryptography is also gaining traction, and projects like [Qanplatform](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/qanplatform/) are at the forefront. Security is paramount in the crypto space, and investing in advanced cryptographic solutions could be a game-changer.\n\nI can't possibly forget GambleFi projects like [Shuffle](https://shuffle.com/) that will bring a new dimension to the crypto space, adding an element of excitement to the ecosystem.\u00a0\n\nReal-world assets (RWA) are also gaining prominence, and [Realio](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/realio-network/) seems to be making waves in this space. You'd agree with me that investing in projects tied to tangible assets provides a sense of stability amidst the crypto volatility.\n\nI'd love to hear your thoughts and insights as well.

The vision of EOS is that everyday users will, in the near future, be able to run dapps from mobile devices with no specialised knowledge - just as they currently do with apps downloaded from the App Store. \n\nCommon examples of businesses that could be displaced:\n\n* Uber\n* AirB&B\n* eBay\n* Facebook\n* Exchanges\n\nFor more information on decentralised applications and the industries they will disrupt:\n\n* [Decentralized Apps Are Around The Corner](https://www.forbes.com/sites/parmyolson/2018/06/25/blockchain-decentralized-apps-dapps/#5da870a623a7) - Forbes \n* [Decentralized Applications](https://blockchainhub.net/decentralized-applications-dapps/) - BlockchainHub\n* [19 Industries The Blockchain Will Disrupt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3psxs3gyf8)\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n####Further Reading:\n* [Whitepaper](https://github.com/EOSIO/Documentation/blob/master/TechnicalWhitePaper.md)\n* [EOS Consensus Presentation May 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUZWZj1pu94)\n* [How does a blockchain work - Simply Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSo_EIwHSd4)\n* [EOS.IO: Why Build a General Purpose Platform?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRAxrqaqGEQ)\n* [Decentralized Funding and the New Corporate Structure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiimIJnVXxU)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n----\n###Why is EOS Different?\n\n&nbsp;\n\nCurrent blockchain platforms are all failing to meet one or more of the following crucial requirements [outlined in the EOS whitepaper](https://github.com/EOSIO/Documentation/blob/master/TechnicalWhitePaper.md#requirements-for-blockchain-applications) that are needed for blockchain applications:\n\n* Free transactions \n* No specialist technical knowledge needed by users\n* The ability for the platform to scale to millions of daily users\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nEOS however provides the following as a priority: \n\n* **Scaleability**\n * Potential to scale to millions of transactions per second\n * Inter-blockchain communication\n * Separates authentication from execution\n* **Flexibility** \n * Freeze and fix broken applications\n * Generalised role based permissions\n * [Web Assembly](http://webassembly.org/)\n* **Usability** \n * Elimination of transaction fees\n * True user accounts\n * Web toolkit for interface development\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n####Further reading:\n\n\n* [The difference between EOS and Ethereum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxKqKVsLYLA&t=193s)\n* [Introduction to Blockchain: Daniel Larimer at Virginia Tech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYAktmG1NuA)\n* [Scaling Blockchain Computation and Storage by Daniel Larimer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cXC7YUm7Rk)\n* [EOS as explained by Dan Larimer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkXuFeN-KMw&t=1287s)\n* [EOS Resource Allocation w/ Daniel Larimer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6CTRdx6NVE)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n##Getting Setup\n\n---\n\n###Accounts, Wallets & Permissions\n\n&nbsp;\n\n##Accounts\n\n\nA key differentiator between EOS and other platforms is that users are assigned accounts with humanly readable 12 character usernames. These usernames can are used to find and interact with these accounts on chain.\n\n>\nAn account is a human-readable name that is stored on the blockchain. It can be owned by an individual or group of individuals depending on permissions configuration. An account is required to transfer or otherwise push a transaction to the blockchain. - *Taken from the [EOSIO GitHub wiki](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/wiki/Accounts-&-Permissions)*\n\nSetting up an account and preloading it with EOS is a requirement to use the EOS network. To do so an existing account must interact with the 'new account' smart contract on the EOS blockchain, there are numerous ways to do this some of which are listed below:\n\n* [EOS Lynx Wallet](https://eoslynx.com/) - **Difficulty:** *Very easy* - Available on IOS/Android/Windows/Mac this wallet lets you create an account in seconds and charges you a very small fee ($0.99 / \u00a30.79) for the EOS it preloads your account with. **If you are new to blockchain or not tech savvy use this option**.\n\n* [Scatter & Bloks.io](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDfu8ZSN6wU) - **Difficulty:** *Medium* - Available on Windows/Mac/Linux. After connecting to your account on bloks.io via Scatter select 'Wallet' -> 'Create account' (pre-existing account required).\n\n* [Greymass](https://github.com/greymass/eos-voter/releases) - **Difficulty:** *Medium* - Available on Windows/Mac/Linux (pre-existing account required).\n\n* [Ledger](https://support.ledgerwallet.com/hc/en-us/articles/360008913653-EOS-EOS-) \n\n* [My EOS Wallet](https://altshiftdev.com/) - MEOW was created to allow EOS holders to access and manage their funds with the trusted security of hardware wallets. Currently MEOW overcomes the limitations of the Ledger wallet by providing a secure interface to interact with dapps etc. [Click here to read more.](https://medium.com/@eos42/introducing-comprehensive-eos-ledger-support-135f0211c064).\n\n\n####Further reading:\n* [EOS Accounts: How They Work and How To Get One](https://medium.com/coinmonks/eos-accounts-how-they-work-and-how-to-get-one-87019c0f7bc7)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n##Wallets\n\n>\nA wallet is software that protects and makes use of your keys. Wallets are clients that store keys that may or may not be associated with the permissions of one or more accounts. Ideally, a wallet has a locked (encrypted) and unlocked (decrypted) state that is protected by a high entropy password. - *Taken from the [EOSIO GitHub wiki](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/wiki/Accounts-&-Permissions)*\n\nThere are a range of wallets now available for EOS - all recommendations below I have tried myself and are in good faith:\n\n* [EOS Lynx Wallet](https://eoslynx.com/) - **Difficulty:** *Very easy* - **Features:** *Basic* - **Platform:** *IOS/Android/Windows/Mac*. A very promising new wallet that currently lets you view your various balances, perform transactions and create new accounts. **If you are new to blockchain or not tech savvy use this option**.\n\n* [Scatter](https://scatter-eos.com/) - **Difficulty:** *Easy* - **Features:** *Extended* - **Platform:** *Windows/Mac/Linux *. Scatter lets websites and desktop apps securely interact with your EOS account without exposing your private keys (similar in functionality to MetaMask). Scatter was one of the first EOS wallets and has a great standing in the community. - [Installing Scatter & connecting to your account with bloks.io](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDfu8ZSN6wU).\n\n* [Greymass](https://github.com/greymass/eos-voter/releases) - **Difficulty:** *Easy* - **Features:** *Extended* - **Platform:** *Linux/Windows/Mac*. A fully featured wallet by the well known Greymass BP candidate. This wallet has been approved by multiple BPs and even given the nod by Dan Larimer himself. Users can vote for BPs, create accounts, generate keys, use offline mode, manage permissions and more.\n\n\n####Further reading:\n* [Accounts, Wallets & Permissions](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/wiki/Accounts-&-Permissions) \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n##Permissions\n>\nEvery transaction has its permissions evaluated under the configured authority of an account. Each named permission has a threshold that must be met for a transaction signed under that authority to be considered valid. Transactions are signed by utilizing a client that has a loaded and unlocked wallet. - *Taken from the [EOSIO GitHub wiki](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/wiki/Accounts-&-Permissions)*\n\n\n\n\nAccess permissions allow accounts to define what combination of keys and/or accounts can send a particular action type to another account. For example, it is possible to have one key for a user's social media account and another for access to the exchange. It is even possible to give other accounts permission to act on behalf of a user's account without assigning them keys.\n\n\n####Further reading:\n\n* [Accounts & Permissions](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/wiki/Accounts-&-Permissions)\n* [Permission Management](https://medium.com/coinmonks/eos-permission-management-2c0c1634fe39)\n* [Permissions & Account Protection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIJhY3ZGQtk)\n* [Recovery from Stolen Keys](https://github.com/EOSIO/Documentation/blob/master/TechnicalWhitePaper.md#recovery-from-stolen-keys)\n* [Whitepaper](https://github.com/EOSIO/Documentation/blob/master/TechnicalWhitePaper.md#accounts)\n\n\n\n\n&nbsp; \n\n\n---\n\n##Getting Technical\n\n---\n\n\n###Understanding EOS consensus\n\n&nbsp; \n\n\n####DPOS\n\n>\nEOS.IO software utilizes the only known decentralized consensus algorithm proven capable of meeting the performance requirements of applications on the blockchain, Delegated Proof of Stake (DPOS). Under this algorithm, those who hold tokens on a blockchain adopting the EOS.IO software may select block producers through a continuous approval voting system. Anyone may choose to participate in block production and will be given an opportunity to produce blocks, provided they can persuade token holders to vote for them. *- [EOS Whitepaper](https://github.com/EOSIO/Documentation/blob/master/TechnicalWhitePaper.md#consensus-algorithm-bft-dpos)*\n\n\n* [What is DPOS - Delegated Proof of Stake?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m0_jnX5Sy0)\n* [EOS: Explanation of DPoS+BFT w/ Daniel Larimer - Part 1 of 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs1dyZFhIr4)\n* [EOS: Explanation of DPoS+BFT w/ Daniel Larimer - Part 2 of 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=57hfF4o4-2A)\n\n\n&nbsp; \n####Block Producers\n\n>\nUsing the EOS.IO software, blocks are produced in rounds of 126 (6 blocks each, times 21 producers). At the start of each round 21 unique block producers are chosen by preference of votes cast by token holders. The selected producers are scheduled in an order agreed upon by 15 or more producers. *- [EOS Whitepaper](https://github.com/EOSIO/Documentation/blob/master/TechnicalWhitePaper.md#consensus-algorithm-bft-dpos)*\n\n* [EOS Go BP List](https://bp.eosgo.io/)\n* [BP Radar Map](https://www.eos-radar.com/)\n* [BP Compliance List](Https://www.eoswire.org/bpcompliance)\n* [AlohaEOS BP Research Portal](https://www.alohaeos.com/vote)\n\n&nbsp; \n####Governance\n>\nAn EOS.IO software-based blockchain implements a governance process that efficiently directs the existing influence of block producers. Absent a defined governance process, prior blockchains relied ad hoc, informal, and often controversial governance processes that result in unpredictable outcomes.\n>\nGovernance is the process by which people in a community:\n>\n1. Reach consensus on subjective matters of collective action that cannot be captured entirely by software algorithms;\n2. Carry out the decisions they reach; and\n3. Alter the governance rules themselves via Constitutional amendments.\n*- [EOS Whitepaper](https://github.com/EOSIO/Documentation/blob/master/TechnicalWhitePaper.md#governance)*\n\n* [Interview with Thomas Cox | EOS Governance and The Future](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXknpB3yWw0)\n* [Q&A - Where to Find the EOS Governance Documents](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTIt-WC-zYo)\n\n&nbsp; \n\n####Voting\n\nThe huge financial incentive to become a BP will draw in wide variety of candidates, each with varying skills sets and ideologies. As token holders it is important that we vote for Block Producer Candidates (BPC's) that are adding maximum value to the EOS ecosystem. Before voting it is highly recommended that you spend a little time researching different candidates and how they plan to add value.\n\nThe main methods of voting are:\n\n1. Command Line Interface (CLI) tools\n2. Graphical User Intereface (GUI) tools\n3. Web Portals\n\n#####Voting Guides: \n* [Step By Step How To Vote For EOS Block Producers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18UfWKxnSYM)\n* [Greymass EOS Voter](https://steemit.com/eos/@greymass/announcing-eos-voter-an-eos-block-producer-voting-tool-and-light-wallet)\n* [Liquid EOS Voting Tool](http://vote.liquideos.com)\n* [Vote Via Greymass Tool In 60 Seconds (Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjFhmlmGqGo)\n* [How to Vote Via cleos](https://eosio.stackexchange.com/questions/725/how-to-vote-using-cleos/726#726)\n\n#####Voting Tools: \n\n* The [cleos CLI tool](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/tree/master/programs/cleos) released by block.one as part of the EOSIO software offers the highest level of security but sacrifices usability due to lack of a friendly interface, as such this method of voting is only recommended for voters with a strong technical background. \n\n* The [Greymass EOS Voter](https://steemit.com/eos/@greymass/announcing-eos-voter-an-eos-block-producer-voting-tool-and-light-wallet) is a GUI tool that has been [endorsed by 10 BPC's](https://steemit.com/eos/@eoscafe/the-road-to-150mm-greymass-eos-voter-tool-endorsement) and is a recommended method for users looking for a quick and simple way to vote. [Click here for a tutorial on voting with the Greymass tool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjFhmlmGqGo).\n\n* Online web portals such as [Bloks.io](https://bloks.io/) are a great way to vote providing you only connect your account via [Scatter](https://scatter-eos.com/) and never directly input a private key into the webpage! Voters should always remain vigilant when interacting with online interfaces and ensure transactions are double-checked before signing with Scatter and ensure the portal they are using has been endorsed by multiple BPC's. \n&nbsp;\n\n\n####Further Resources:\n* [Scatter](https://scatter-eos.com/)\n* [Scatter Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDfu8ZSN6wU)\n*  [EOS Mainnet Launch: The Order of Events](https://medium.com/@eosnewyork/eos-mainnet-launch-the-order-of-events-ed89a816beb8)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n####Getting Connected\n---\n\n###Conferences & meetups\n\n&nbsp; \n\nWant to learn more?

They were working closely with all the EOSIO chain like EOS, WAX, Telos, ... together (with the Block Producers and the developers). Now there is an EEP to go even more open source: [https://eos.io/news/eep-program/?utm\\_source=twitter&utm\\_medium=social&utm\\_campaign=eosio\\_tools&utm\\_content=EEP](https://eos.io/news/eep-program/?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=eosio_tools&utm_content=EEP)\n\nHere is a good summary as well about the relationship of EOS, EOSIO and block.one:\n\n[https://forums.eoscommunity.org/t/debunking-fud-and-wrong-information-around-eos](https://forums.eoscommunity.org/t/debunking-fud-and-wrong-information-around-eos)\n\nAnd here is a good tweet what happened with the ICO money from block.one:\n\n[https://twitter.com/bywirenews/status/1443934950164729859?s=19](https://twitter.com/bywirenews/status/1443934950164729859?s=19)\n\nThe EOS public chain was started by the community [eoscommunity.org](https://eoscommunity.org) and with time there were more and more exchanges coming into the top 21 as Block Producers. So I would say it's a mix now between some of the early BP's who were able to compete against exchanges. When [block.one](https://block.one) (EOSIO) release a new update, the BP's are testing it and then upgrade the chain. Mostly in this testing process they are working together with [block.one](https://block.one) and giving them feedback. As well in case of critical bugs or network incidents, there are processes in place where within hours, BP's communicate the bug to b1, they release a patch and then all the 21 nodes get updated as an emergency update. The last time the whole process took around 4 hours, where other networks have months to do this. \ud83d\ude09 So there is a very important connection between EOSIO and EOS.\n\nwho are the Block Producers on EOS? Get to know them here (I will add the intro's as they come out - Chris started to introduce them):\n\n\\#EOS BP Interviews #1 - EOS Costa Rica: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKqzzc\\_qSIg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKqzzc_qSIg)\n\n\\#EOS BP Interviews #2 - Greymass: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06UCxMnKJtw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06UCxMnKJtw)\n\n\\#EOS BP Interviews #3 - EOS Amsterdam: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uzhmheZYmE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uzhmheZYmE)\n\n\\#EOS BP Interviews #4 - CryptoLions: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZtUb\\_Jgt\\_k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZtUb_Jgt_k)\n\n\\#EOS BP Interviews #5 - EOS USA: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yL8WvxoCFzU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yL8WvxoCFzU)\n\n\\#EOS BP Interviews #6 - Pizza BP:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDNhXgrgqMI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDNhXgrgqMI)\n\n\\#EOS BP Interviews #7 - EOS Argentina: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqVH6jjzWpA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqVH6jjzWpA)\n\n\\#EOS BP Interviews #8 - EOS MicroLoans [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzv6lgck-FE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzv6lgck-FE)\n\n\\#EOS BP Interviews #9 - EOS Detroit [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJ6uQ0HcNb8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJ6uQ0HcNb8)\n\nThen what ETH2 is trying to achieve, EOS has it already in place. EOS has already super cheap transactions. At the moment one transaction is around 0.0005 EOS ($0.002). If EOS would be $4000 if all stays the same, one tx would be ($2). But as the infrastructure is improving meanwhile (hardware and software), the CPU time which is needed to do a transaction will get smaller. This means it's likely by the time EOS is worth $4000, the CPU amount to buy will be smaller, so it will continue to get cheaper. You can see here, the BP's improved their performance already in the last 2 years from 1.5ms to 0.2ms: [https://www.alohaeos.com/tools/benchmarks#networkId=1&timeframeId=11&outliers=0](https://www.alohaeos.com/tools/benchmarks#networkId=1&timeframeId=11&outliers=0)\n\nBut the main difference to other networks is the permission system and the architecture which makes EOSIO unique. Big players of any EOSIO network can pay the transaction cost for the end user. This is already done in WAX completely and in EOS it is done in a limited way. Like this the network have no transaction fee for the end user. The power users still have to pay a small fee and the tx cost for the end user are with the big players. Like this the network is ready for prime time and mass adoption.\n\nPlus like we see in Venezuela, EOSIO can help as well to build up a currency. They use EOS for this. A country and people in hyper inflation are not able to pay fees. So we can help them and pay the fees for them and with [eosmicroloan.com](https://eosmicroloan.com) they started to build up their economy again. This is just not possible with any other cryptocurrency, because with all others, the end user has to pay fees. If you don't have any money, you will use paper and pen, if you have to pay fee. That's why EOSIO is by now the only network which really is helping this people (except for the once who have the money to speculate). And with the MLT token from EOS Microloan, the interest of the loan for the end user is zero, so they can invest and re-initiate the economy, while the owner of the loan and all people who do transactions get rewarded in MLT tokens, which later get bought up by the companies who are successful to be able to do marketing on [eosmarketplace.io](https://eosmarketplace.io). Like this all the people get rewarded as well as more they transact and help to grow the economy. It's genius. They call it human finance (HuFi). They are creating their own liquidity with producing goods and services. Real sound money and not just printed out of thin air!\n\n# \n\n# Most important news and developments happening on EOS\n\n  \n**The EOS Community stopped the payment to b1 to develop the EOSIO software protocol and is organizing now to develop the protocol them self.**\n\nIn 2021 b1 moved their EOSIO core development team to [bullish.com](https://bullish.com) and started to focus only on development what bullish exchange needs and no more what public chains like EOS, Telos, WAX, etc. needed. So the EOS Community decided to stopped the payment (vesting of EOS tokens) to [block.one](https://block.one) which was a social contract to keep developing EOSIO software over the next 10 years.   \nThe EOS Community and it's sister chains are organizing now to develop the EOSIO protocol them self.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Wyoming legally recognizes EOS-based DAO in historic move:** [https://www.google.com/amp/s/cryptoslate.com/wyoming-legally-recognizes-eos-based-dao-in-historic-move/amp/](https://www.google.com/amp/s/cryptoslate.com/wyoming-legally-recognizes-eos-based-dao-in-historic-move/amp/) \\- [https://www.americancryptofed.org](https://www.americancryptofed.org/) \\- An inflation and deflation protected EOS Stablecoin with unlimited issuance, constrained by algorithms targeting zero inflation and zero deflation. Ducat is used for daily transactions and as a store of value...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Announcement EOS Foundation 6. of August 2021:**\n\nWith the backing and support from Daniel Larimer, the creator and architect of EOSIO, Yves La Rose, former CEO of EOS Nation, is formally requesting that the EOS block producers increase network inflation by 2% to fund an EOS Foundation which will lead the vision and roadmap for the EOS blockchain. The Foundation is also requesting to use legacy network fees to initially bootstrap this initiative. Daniel has been advising Yves on his plans to launch the Foundation and recommends him to serve as its executive director and chief ambassador to EOS. The Foundation\u2019s core mission is to provide grants, sponsorships, and key infrastructure support that has been lacking in EOS. Using a more centralized business approach, The Foundation will be able to efficiently deliver on its mission due to its ability to make decisions quickly while being able to pivot as needed to find product market fit. At its core, the Foundation will work to empower developers, businesses, and individuals to build on EOS. Providing funding to Eden on EOS will be one such initiative. The combination of an EOS Foundation and Eden working together in parallel will bestow EOS with both a centralized and decentralized system to provide it with both a top down and bottom up approach for funding the ecosystem growth, support, and marketing initiatives that EOS is currently lacking.

Coinbase did not send my crypto, my SOL or my USDC, then they claimed I had to confirm my identity to remove my crypto. I confirmed my ID several times for each transaction, they denied it when it was obviously me and they had just accepted an ID check 3 days prior. \n\nI went to support about it and they literally would not release my crypto to me until SOL went back up and I no longer had the chance to buy it at a good enough price without their exorbitant fee. They said that they couldn't send it because the \"network was too clogged and I would get the money when it unclogged.\"\n\nI now realize that until my crypto leaves CB... it's not mine. I suspect what happened is that CB actually meant that they did not have enough money to give me back my crypto until the market went back up. \n\nLesson learned, if you are still using CB, do yourself a favor and get your crypto out as soon as you can, because I suspect CB is having more money troubles than they are letting on.

        "post_title": "[Howto] Paper Wallet: generate, deposit, withdraw, consult",
        "post_body": "Hi xrp'ers @ /r/ripple & /r/xrp,\n\nI see a lot of questions about paper wallets lately. Got some messages regarding paper wallets as well. This is my attempt at combining all my explanations in one howto.\n\n# What is a paper wallet\nA paper wallet is a XRP wallet you can generate offline and print. When you generate a paper wallet, you generally print it (multiple times) and store the paper wallet in a (very) safe place. Don't store all the copies in one building, since you want to be able to retrieve a copy if something terrible happens.\n\nOne of the advantages of a paper wallet is is that it's \"unhackable\" - if someone hacks your computer, your keys* aren't stored on it. Just keep them safe ;)\n\nA paper wallet contains 2 keys (text) and most of the times 2 QR codes (one for each key).\n\nWhen your XRP is stored in your own wallet, the XRP's are **yours**. When your XRP is on an exchange, you might loose access to your XRP's (if the exchange goes offline, freezes your account, etc.) - so if you want to hold on to your XRP's for some time, better send them to your own wallet.\n\n# How about the wallet keys?\n\nThere are two keys: the public key (wallet address) and the private key (secret key). The wallet address starts with a **r** and the private key starts with the letter **s**.\n\nThe wallet address is generated from the private key. This means you can loose your wallet address (the one starting with **r**) since you can just re-generate the same address from your private key.\n\n**The private key is for your eyes only (!!!) - If someone has access to your private key they have access to all the funds stored in the Ripple wallet.**\n\nPlease don't share your private key, please don't store it somewhere in a document on your computer, and **never** enter it somewhere **except if you trust the place you are entering the key**.\n\nYour wallet address (starting with **r**) is kind of your \"XRP Wallet bank account number\". You can send XRP to this wallet. You can check the transactions from your wallet (more below, 'consult'). \n\nYour private key (starting with **s**) is kind of your PIN + Username + Password for online banking: you can access all your funds and send them somewhere. Risky!\n\n---\n\n# How to generate a paper wallet\n\nThere are many places offering to generate your paper wallet, however: **some of them can't be trusted**. Imagine the website generating the wallet stores the generated values, and waits untill you deposit your XRP: since they have the private key they can steal your funds.\n\nI prefer generating a wallet with open source code, so the geeks can audit the source code. **[Here you can find a wallet generator I trust](https://octillionsa.github.io/generate-ripple-wallet/)**. You can even [download](https://github.com/OctillionSA/generate-ripple-wallet) it and run it locally (offline)\n\nIf you want to (offline) generate a vanity wallet (wallet with your own keyword / name in the wallet address) you can **[check this out](https://github.com/WietseWind/xrp-vanity-generator)**.\n\n>**BIG FAT WARNING FOR SAFARI OSX AND IOS (IPHONE/IPAD) USERS** Safari on OSX and iOS **may** generate **INVALID KEYS** resulting in an invalid private key. This means that, if you one day try to access your funds, you can't. **DO NOT EVER** generate your paper wallet on a mobile device, and if you're working on an Mac with OSX, **DO NOT USE Safari**, use Google Chrome, Firefox, Vivaldi, etc. instead!\n\n## **Security**\n\nIf you want to be sure the generated values aren't stored, you can download the source-code, store it at your computer, unplug your computer from the internet, reboot, generate, print, reboot and plugin the internet again. If you're a geek yourself, you can generate a wallet offline using the nodejs Ripple-Lib code. [Here's a sample](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/WietseWind/01f1eb0819533ed0226b2777618f253d/raw/86a2546070c623b870ab2a6d1df95f6263859e02/generate-xrp-wallet.js).\n\n---\n\n# How to get XRP into your wallet (deposit)\n\nSend XRP to your wallet address (starting with **r**). Most exchanges offer to withdraw XRP. You can enter your wallet address as the recipient. \n\nIf you are asked for a destination tag and the address you are sending the XRP to is your own paper wallet, you can leave the _destination tag_ empty or enter a zero (0). The destination tag can only contain numbers, and can be used to distinguish funds entering your wallet.\n\n---\n\n# How to check my balance\n\nSince the XRP ledger is open to the world, the whole world can check your balance. However: as long as you keep your wallet address to yourself, no one will know the wallet belongs to you. To check your balance, you can use one of the publicly available tools, and enter your wallet address.\n\nI like these two:\n\n- **https://bithomp.com/explorer/**\n- **https://ripple.com/build/ripple-info-tool/**\n\nOf course you can install a wallet on your phone or computer and check your balance with the app; the app can be used to transfer/withdraw your XRP as well. For iOS and Android, give **[Toast Wallet](https://toastwallet.com/)** a spin. \n\n**NOTE: If you decide to use one of the available wallets, remember you have to enter your _private key_. Only enter the private key if you trust the app. Remember: if anyone gains control over your private key, they can steal your funds**! However: since Toast Wallet is open source, everyone can audit the source code. \n\n---\n\n# How to get XRP out of your wallet (transfer/withdraw)\n\nTo send XRP from your wallet to another wallet address (like the wallet address of an exchange) you need to generate a transaction and sign the transaction with your **private key**. You can do this with any XRP wallet you trust. \n\nIf you install wallet software you can enter your private key to allow the wallet software to sign your transaction. \n\nIf you install Toast Wallet on your iOS or Android device, you can set a PIN code, and then go to:\n\n- Add wallet\n- Existing wallet\n- Enter the private key in the first field, leave the address field empty (it will be generated from the private key). Enter a description and pick a password. You need the password to confirm transactions for this wallet in Toast Wallet.\n\nIf you want to use [Gatehub](https://www.gatehub.net/), you can access your own wallet:\n\n- Wallet\n- <+> (Add wallet)\n- Import (enter your Gatehub password)\n- Enter your Secret Key",

It's like a great mystery as to why this is not on several major exchanges already, in particular Bittrex, which fed off ZCL for a while and knows all too well this would bring in major money.\n\nI have little doubts it will soon get listed. As to why it hasn't already, I suspect foul play, either someone wants more money to list it or they are paying money to keep it from being listed. So either BTCP team is cheaping out and believing big exchanges will list BTCP without the 'donation' or BCH, ZEC team putting pressure on exchanges not to list.\n\n\nLittle 'Ol Trade Satoshi is the only one milking this cow and he can only carry two jugs, when it could produce 10,000 litres a day.\n\n",

        "post_body": "**EDIT: I appreciate the positive feedback and the kind words. It means a lot.** I hope you all find the chart helpful. Unfortunately though, I'm here to tell you that **I'm not going to update it anymore**. I got **immense back pain** because of my broken chair and I can't continue working like this. I don't have money to buy a new one and considering that I received zero donation/support (aside from 0.5$) it just **isn't worth it for me** to continue working on this chart, and this way also **risking my health.** Again, thank you to everyone for their kind works, I really appreciate them!\n\n\\---\n\n**INTRODUCTION**\n\nHey everyone! This took me around 300 hours of dedicated work (tons of research and sleepless nights). But I'm finally finished with it and I'm proud to present to you the ultimate, the most complete crypto YouTuber tier list & analysis chart you have ever seen, with so many informations that will blow your mind (hopefully).\n\n\\---\n\n**WHAT IS THIS?**\n\n[A quick look at the Tier List & Ranking tab.](https://preview.redd.it/tinnsygv53371.png?width=2341&format=png&auto=webp&s=41b916243439ca35177bd4314655eeaeed529eb7)\n\nIt's a comprehensive chart of more than 110 crypto YouTubers/channels that incorporates tons of written information and mathematics-driven statistics that helps you to identify the quality and trustability of the given content creators. The chart features roughly 17 different types of data (written and mathematics-driven) for each and every YouTube channel.\n\nThis list doesn't just show you which YouTubers you should subscribe to and why, but also which ones you should avoid and/or which ones you should prioritize if you are looking for price predictions, or guides etc. It paints a complete picture. Or at least as much as it is possible by the work of one man.\n\n\\---\n\n**WHY I MADE THIS CHART?**\n\n[A quick look at the Recommendations tab.](https://preview.redd.it/huksrjz0qy271.png?width=1157&format=png&auto=webp&s=985d5d026a405d5048248708a7d8b1180ce42562)\n\nCrypto is going mainstream. Right now, an overwhelming majority of rookie investors/traders rely first and foremost on YouTube content creators to make their financial decisions and/or to educate themeselves, but it is just as true for the most part in the case of more experienced traders (there are many reasons behind this, but these are irrelevant here).\n\nSo I felt it was important to create some kind of a comprehensive and content rich source that provides as much information and help to people as possible when it comes to these YouTubers they (want to) follow, so they can eventually make the best financial decisions and so on and so forth.\n\n\\---\n\n**DISCLAIMERS**\n\n[A quick look at the Useful Informations tab.](https://preview.redd.it/dkpgrlw1qy271.png?width=1041&format=png&auto=webp&s=f26cf314087cc81fe65d666eb3185d4405bbaf77)\n\nI'm one man. Even though I have spent 300 hours (more than 2 months) making this chart, it more than likely has some flaws, miscalculations, misjudgements about a channel or person, contradictions etc. It's practically unavoidable when we are talking about this amount of data (you'll see). Also,  I can't know everything about every YouTuber.\n\nBut that's partially the reason why there's so many different types of data for each and every YouTuber. Even if you do not agree with some data (that are less math-driven and more subjective) or even if there's a mistake somewhere, all of the data combined together will more than likely paint a realistic picture about the given content creator.\n\nOh, and I'm also not a native English speaker so sorry for any grammatical errors. Plus I know that token and coin is not precisely the same but for conveniance, I used them interchangably in the chart.\n\n\\---\n\n**HOW TO SUPPORT ME?**\n\n[A quick look at the Currency Summary tab.](https://preview.redd.it/rj6g3sz2qy271.png?width=1262&format=png&auto=webp&s=61e9be93134831f8f2272d1f4ab374d27fe41ead)\n\nJust to make things clear, I'm not some kind of a rich crypto invenstor/trader... far from it. I'm from a relatively poor country and I'm someone who has started crypto only a couple of months ago and invested his spare 660 dollars into proven, good quality coins... a couple of weeks before the big crash... so... you probably guess the ruest. I don't even have money for a new chair so I made this list with continuous and immense back pain because I used this [broken chair](https://i.imgur.com/ZEuhBJH.jpg) while I was working. I still wanted to help people the only way I could in the crypto space.\n\nNow, I would be very humbled and would deeply appreciate it if you would consider doing the same and supporting my work if you found it in any way helpful. This chart is extensive and content rich, I made sure of it, but it's still just a rough blueprint / foundation on which many things can be build upon. And I'll gladly do that if there's enough interest in it and I'm more than happy to let the community to get involved too in this project to help to perfect it.\n\nBut for the continuous development of this chart, I need your help. You can support me by opening the chart, then clicking on the Donation/Support tab (there, you can see all the possible options). Additionally, if you want it, I'll display your name in the Donation/Support tab of the chart so everyone can see that you supported my work.\n\nIf you wouldn't like to support me this way and/or you can't, please, share my work and leave a like on it if you find it helpful so it can reach more people.\n\n\\---\n\n**THE CHART**\n\n[Every single YouTuber\\/channel has an overview\\/intrudiction. Here are a few examples.](https://preview.redd.it/wrja3xx3qy271.png?width=1488&format=png&auto=webp&s=25275ecfaa7bad71eb586e05d5d24c6ff707f8e2)\n\nI was thinking about explaining how the chart works, but pretty much every single column/row in it has some kind of a written explanation paired with it. The chart has everything you need to won't get lost and to be able to understand every information and data it contains.\n\n\\---\n\n# [LINK TO THE CHART (GOOGLE SHEETS)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bvEmMAq22sxsOSPUFupGoA-I1XYJqfBn/view?usp=sharing)\n\n**You need to be signed in into a Google account in order to be able to view notes, e.g. YouTuber/channel overviews, category explanations etc. (marked by a black triangle in the top right corner). After you have logged in, click on the \"Open With\" button at the top of the screen, then click on \"Google Sheets\".**\n\n\\---\n\n**EDIT 1:** The chart is updated with three Adjusted values (Adjusted Simple Score, Adjusted Complex Score, and Adjusted Tier). These will better reflect the overall quality of the given channel and/or a channel's relative quality to other ones, if you only really want to rely one on statistics to compare them.\n\n**EDIT 2:** Even though I said I'm not going to work on the chart anymore, I made another tab (Best To Worst Ranking) that you can use to check all the crypto YouTube channels in descending order (from best to worst, based on Adjusted Complex Score).",

        "post_body": "Source: https://medium.com/@bytemaster/proposal-for-eos-resource-renting-rent-distribution-9afe8fb3883a\n\n\"Under heavy congestion (sustained load over 10%), the staking algorithm of EOS would give about 100 microseconds per day of guaranteed CPU time per 1 EOS staked. **A trader wanting to transact once per minute** (where each transaction requires 1ms) would **require stake of about 15,000 EOS (or about $100,000 dollars as of August 2018)**. Many traders lack that much capital and few would want to expose it to volatility risks just to trade.\"\n\nLarimer's article then goes on to outline how developers can rent EOS at 5% per year instead. Given the volatility and uncertainty of holding EOS, I think EOS holders are unlikely to be satisfied with renting out their tokens for a measly 5% return, however. I think 15%-20% is more likely, but for argument's sake, let's assume it's 10%. \n\nThis means that the cost per year for renting enough EOS to run a Dapp that can handle 1 transaction per minute would be $10,000 (i.e. $100k * 10%). \n\nNow, this article (https://medium.com/@cryptolabb/eos-1-000-000-transactions-per-second-6e55cd83a81b) states that Facebook is processing 54,800 likes per second, or 3.2 million transactions per minute. \n\nThus, if it costs $10k per year to run an app on EOS that can handle 1 transaction per minute, it would follow that running a Dapp that needs 3.2 million transactions per minute would cost 3.2 million times as much, or $32 billion per year. Facebook's revenues are \"only\" $55 billion a year at this point, and in addition to Likes, they also process comments, AI, and a whole host of other things. Running an app with Facebook-like economics (which are among the industry's best) appears economically impossible. \n\nI understand that as the TPS for EOS increases, the cost can go down (assuming the price holds steady). But still, this seems stupidly expensive and unsustainable by almost any measure, and would only worsen if some of the EOS price targets ($100+) that I see around here become true.\n\nNote that the fact that Facebook's absolute scale is massive is not important here. What's important is the ratio of its revenues to its costs. I.e., the same math would hold true even if Facebook only processed 1% as many likes per second as it does today, if it also only had 1% the revenues it has today.\n\nWhat am I missing in order for it to make economical sense for a social network app of any scale to run on EOS? Are we just waiting for a ton more TPS-capacity while hoping price doesn't go up in tandem? \n\nLastly, I don't have an angle or agenda as it relates to EOS (neither positive, nor negative). Simply trying to understand the basic economics of running a Dapp on the platform. I am fully aware that doing the same thing on Etherum would be orders of magnitude more expensive, but that seems irrelevant to the question at hand. ",

        "post_body": "Hi, so I want to have an actual discussion about what it seems many of you are overlooking.\n\n1) I see most of you (and the \"whitepaper\") comparing BTCP to Bitcoin and Bitcoin/Bitcoin Cash/Bitcoin Gold. The actual thing I think we need to be comparing it to to are the other privacy coins, and most importantly: zcash and to a lesser extent, zencash (which I'm aware is a fork of zclassic, but it readds a smaller founder's fee, and actually added new, novel features (see: secure nodes, which eliminated for them a TERRIFYING problem zclassic has, very few nodes. Having to copy/paste IPs off a random website to get node connections, because the seed nodes don't seem to ever work is a bewildering security risk and just kind of inexplicable that no one on the team seems to give a shit). I ended up setting up a public ZCL node specifically to guarantee my own access to the actual blockchain. Why isn't that a bigger deal? \n\nI know theres a lot  of blind exuberance here, but I just don't see how there is ANY chance whatsoever of BTCP EVER being worth more than zcash. If you actually look at the github commit logs from zcash->zclassic, its mainly a rename and the removal of the founder's fee. If you look at the commit logs from zclassic->BTCP, its primarily renaming and the adjustment of some hardcoded values (block reward, etc). I was very disappointed in this \"Whitepaper\" (which, if you exclude the fluff/re-explanation of the voluntary miner contribution program is barely 5 pages...), when I first heard about this \"whitepaper\", I immediately thought \"Want a whitepaper? Read zcash, because that is what this is with small adjustments to some hardcoded values and a search/replace on the word 'zcash'->zclassic->bitcoinprivate\"\n\n2) I know theres some libre handwaving at the removal of the founder's fee from zcash->zclassic, and now the reintroduction of, albeit voluntarily, founder's fee. Much smaller, but still essentially a founder's fee. Lets consider what that zcash founder's fee actually is buying: the support of the big banks (JPM). The banks are heavily involved in cryptos now, more so than any of us, whether you like it or not. Having the banks support is what is actually going to enable another cryptocurrency to supplant bitcoin. I stay away from cryptos like Ripple because its founder's fee is ~60%, and it seems the banks interested in it are merely interested in the technology, they can make their own cryptocurrency and make their own made up ~40 billion tokens. The banks are going to get their cut one way or the other, having them on their (zcash's) side is to their benefit. In the Bitcoin Private case, that money is instead going to be used primarily to essentialy bribe the horrendously corrupt big exchanges. Do you think Zcash pays to get on exchanges?\n\n3) I must've missed the part where the BTC->BTCP effective airdrop went from 1:0.1 BTC:BTCP to 1:1 BTC:BTCP. My question: *WHY?* I get the very very marginal \"burn\" of long term unclaimed BTCP, but like... this didnt have to happen and I really don't see the reason to gut mining on a PoW chain that none of the dev team has proven the ability to significantly alter, all for a handwavey \"lowest inflation ever in a cryptocurrency\" schtick (which is provably NOT TRUE, see cryptocurrencies like Unobtanium (UNO))\n\nAnyways, FULL DISCLOSURE: I do hold ZCL, I am currently contributing to the voluntary miner program, and I LEGITIMATELY WANT TO BELIEVE (and get rich, just like all of you), but over the past couple weeks I have grown EXTREMELY skeptical of whats going on here and think that it is starting to make a lot more sense to invest in the other zcash/zcash-derived cryptos (zcash/zencash/zcoin), because I'm really not sure what this fork is buying anyone, other than the marketing potential of re-adding the word 'Bitcoin' to the project...\n\nTell me I'm wrong.\n\n**UPDATE**: Annnd predictably a bunch of you idiots start shouting 'FUD' and imply i'm being paid by the boogey man, wow, just wanted to have a conversation, if the answers are so obvious, why not form 2 sentences to say them.\n\n**UPDATE**:\n And no, I am probably not dumping my ZCL and none of you should at this point either, at this point it'd be kind of silly to, we've made our beds, and I'm likely holding till post fork, hopefully it works out. I'm just hoping theres a single one of you somewhere that is capable of responding as an intellectual and reasonable person...\n\n**FINAL UPDATE**: \nI have dumped the majority of my ZCL while I can still turn a profit, and I recommend you all do the same. If you really believe in BTCP long term, buy it in 3 days for like ~$15 per.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinPrivate/comments/80lmpt/btcp_marketcap_needs_to_reach_at_least_2b_to_sell/duwmdnn/",

There's only been people here and on XMR trader shouting for months that exchanges directly invovled with new Tether prints are probably fractionally reserved. We've been explaining that they're probably using any real Monero on their exchanges to maintain leveraged shorts with price suppression. And that's in addition to the naked short that selling non-existent Monero actually is.\n\nIf you leave your XMR on BitFinex, Poloniex, Binance, Huobi, or any exchange that receives new Tether prints, you're hurting us. Use a *reputable* regulated exchange if you're gonna trade. Kraken is probably the best here, and they're very likely fully reserved. They're trying to integrate into the banking system, and generally can't afford to do those kinds of manipulation and lies.\n\nOr just use a decentralized exchange. Or better yet, *stop trading.* Most people get rekt doing it. We need to squeeze the shit out of liquidity on these price manipulators. It's time to put an end to this. They don't have loads of ASIC mined and premined Monero to dump on retail. They hate that they can't see the onchain flows. They want to suppress price and make Monero their own personal little laundromat.\n\nMonero is for *The People* not for a narrow set of corporate parasites. Pull your damn coins OFF of the exchanges.\n\nDo it NOW.\"",

        "post_body": "All FAQs listed below have been pulled directly from the bitcoincash.org website. If you have any additional questions and answers to add to this, please leave a comment in the thread below or message the mod team.\n\n***\n\n**What is Bitcoin Cash?**\n\nBitcoin Cash is peer-to-peer electronic cash for the Internet. It is fully decentralized, with no central bank and requires no trusted third parties to operate.\n\n***\n\n**Is Bitcoin Cash different from 'Bitcoin'?**\n\nYes.  Bitcoin Cash is the continuation of the Bitcoin project as peer-to-peer digital cash.  It is a fork of the Bitcoin blockchain ledger, with upgraded consensus rules that allow it to grow and scale.\n\n***\n\n**If I own Bitcoin, do I automatically own Bitcoin Cash too?**\n\nAnyone who held Bitcoin at the time Bitcoin Cash was created became owners of Bitcoin Cash. This means that Bitcoin holders as of block 478558 (August 1st, 2017 about 13:16 UTC) have the same amount of Bitcoin Cash as they had Bitcoin at that time.  If your Bitcoins are stored by a third party such as an exchange, then you must inquire with them about your Bitcoin Cash.\n \nAny transactions after the August 1st ledger split are completely separate between Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. This means any Bitcoin acquired after the split does not include any Bitcoin Cash, and any Bitcoin Cash does not include any Bitcoin.\n\nHow is transaction replay being handled between the new and the old blockchain?\nBitcoin Cash transactions use a new signature hashing algorithm indicated by the flag SIGHASH_FORKID. These signatures are not valid on the legacy blockchain. This prevents Bitcoin Cash transactions from being replayed on the Bitcoin blockchain and vice versa.\n\n***\n\n**Why was a fork necessary to create Bitcoin Cash?**\n\nThe legacy Bitcoin code had a maximum limit of 1MB of data per block, or about 3 transactions per second.  Although technically simple to raise this limit, the community could not reach a consensus, even after years of debate.\n\u200b\nWas the 1 MB block size limit causing problems for Bitcoin?\n\nYes, In 2017, capacity hit the 'invisible wall'.  Fees skyrocketed, and Bitcoin became unreliable, with some users unable to get their transactions confirmed, even after days of waiting.\n\nBitcoin stopped growing.  Many users, merchants, businesses and investors abandoned Bitcoin. Its marketshare among other cryptocurrencies  quickly plummeted from 95% to 40%. \n\n***\n\n**Does Bitcoin Cash fix these problems?**\n\nYes.  Bitcoin Cash immediately raised the block size limit to 8MB as part of a massive on-chain scaling approach.  There will be ample capacity for everyone's transactions.\n\nLow fees and fast confirmations will resume with Bitcoin Cash.  The network will be allowed to grow again.  Users, merchants, businesses, and investors will return.\n\n***\n\u200b\n**Why didn't Bitcoin raise the block size if it was easy?**\n\nSome of the developers did not understand and agree with the original vision of peer-to-peer electronic cash that Satoshi Nakamoto had created. Instead, they preferred Bitcoin become a settlement layer.\n\nMany miners and users trusted these developers, while others recognized that they were leading the community down a different road than expected. \n\nThese two very different visions for Bitcoin are largely incompatible, which led to the community divide.\n\n***\n\u200b\n**Which Development Team is In Charge of Bitcoin Cash?**\n\nUnlike the previous situation in Bitcoin, there is no one single development team for Bitcoin Cash.  There are now multiple independent teams of developers. \n\nThis decentralization of development (and decentralization of software implementations) is a much needed and important step forward.",

Educate yourself on how BTC became as widespread as it did in a grassroots fashion before the problems started and try to apply a bit of that when the opportunity presents itself in your own life.  BCH, in my opinion, entered the space with a head start. \n\nPersonally, I\u2019m headed to two Christmas parties this weekend and shaved off just under 3 BCH from my cold storage so I can get some other\u2019s started on the spot after they download and setup a wallet.

        "post_title": "[BYTECOIN GUIDE FOR NEWBIES!] Everything you have to know about Bytecoin in 3 minutes.",
        "post_body": "**What is Bytecoin?**\n\nBytecoin is an [open-sourced](https://github.com/amjuarez/bytecoin), private and untraceable cryptocurrency that was started in [2012](https://chainradar.com/bcn/transaction/9afeb29a9f3bd0d84c3d0081c47138c3a1cadd932215b59b146444ba6914e551). \n\n**Bytecoin** is the first coin that implemented [CryptoNote](https://cryptonote.org/) technology as a default aspect to build a project. Launched in 2012, Bytecoin was widely spread in the Dark Net as one of the popular available methods for payment. The main thing that separates Bytecoin from most of the other coins is total anonymity - as soon as your transaction appears on a blockchain, your address can\u2019t be viewed by anyone. \n\nBytecoin has shown huge growth potential in all of its indexes. Since December 2016 the price per coin has [increased](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bytecoin-bcn/) by 171 times and made over 17000% from growth to the early investors. During the project\u2019s lifetime, the amount of users has increased significantly. As of the beginning of December 2017, we have more than 20,000 loyal users (contributors, community enthusiasts, developers, broadcasters, etc.), so Bytecoin\u2019s community is staying as one of the most talented and active ones. Today\u2019s blockchain statistics are also spreading the word that Bytecoin is heading towards mainstream adoption - almost 1,500,000 transactions have been made according to Bytecoin\u2019s [blockchain](https://minergate.com/blockchain/bcn/blocks).  \n\nBytecoin is the forefather of all of the [anonymous cryptocurrencies](http://mapofcoins.com/bytecoin#) based on CryptoNote technology. Here\u2019s a list of the tech features and specifications Bytecoin has:\n\n**Ring Signatures**\n\nA [Ring signature](https://www.ccn.com/interview-harry-ullman-bytecoin/) is a special type of digital signature that can be created by someone from a group of users, but it is unknown who exactly the signer is. Imagine a letter that is signed by a group of 10 people. You know that one of them signed the letter, but there\u2019s no way to identify who it actually was (you may only guess). This introduces the untraceable properties, which means that for any Bytecoin payment there is a number of equal probable senders.\n\n**Unlinkable Transactions**\n\nUnlinkable transactions make the Bytecoin blockchain resistant to being scanned, which means it\u2019s possible to see the details of a user\u2019s transaction, but no one will know the sender or the recipient.\n\n**Stealth Addresses**\n\nWith stealth addresses it\u2019s not possible to know the sender and the recipient because of the outputs associated with certain addresses, moreover, it\u2019s impossible to know who belongs to a certain output. \n\nThe complexity of the features above makes Bytecoin absolutely unique. Moreover, Bytecoin\u2019s Development Team has some ideas for the potential improvement of Bytecoin to make it even more anonymous and [reliable](https://bytecoin.org/blog/bytecoin-2018-roadmap-1,-2-quater). \n\n**Is it profitable to invest in Bytecoin?**\n\nInvesting in Bytecoin means: A. Investing in your anonymity and B. Investing in breakthrough technology. In fact, investing in Bytecoin seems to be one of the most profitable solutions in  2021 for one obvious reason - today\u2019s Bytecoin isn\u2019t as widely spread as it is able to be, however, it has a huge potential. For now, Bytecoin is only represented on 9 [exchange platforms](https://bytecoin.org/ecosystem), while it is possible to be listed in additional markets, the price has to increase significantly in order to help this come about so that new traders will be able to buy Bytecoins. In this case, investing in Bytecoin today will double your USD deposits by at least twice towards the end of 2018. Moreover, in December 2017 99,5% of coins have been mined, which means the emission has to end soon (in about a year), which will definitely lead (according to the [economical model](https://bytecoin.org/about/what-is-bytecoin)) to slight and stable price growth.\n\n**Where can I buy Bytecoins?**\n\nHere\u2019s a list of the exchange platforms to trade BCN with different cryptocurrencies:\n\n[Poloniex](https://poloniex.com/). Available pairs: BCN/USDT.\n\n[HitBTC](https://hitbtc.com/).  Available pairs: BCN/BTC, BCN/USDT, BCN/ETH, and BCN/EOS.\n\n[Gate.io](https://gate.io/).

Kindly visit [this page](https://bytecoin.org/blog/guide-how-to-mine-bytecoin-on-windows) for answers.  \n\n**Where can I store my coins?**\n\nThere are several options on places to store your coins, starting from the exchange platforms which have inner wallets like [Poloniex](https://poloniex.com/), [HitBTC](https://hitbtc.com/), and [Cryptonator](https://www.cryptonator.com/). However, the most secure way to store your coins is to keep them in outside wallets. Here\u2019s a list of wallet options to store your coins:\n\n[Official Desktop Wallet](https://bytecoin.org/downloads). If you\u2019ve faced some difficulties with setting up the wallet, take a look at the [instructions](https://bytecoin.org/docs/bytecoin-wallet-manual) or the [guide](https://coinwalletguide.com/bytecoin-desktop-wallet/). You may also watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3noSRHIAGu0&feature=youtu.be) for information on how to use the wallet. \n \n[Official Web Wallet](https://bytecoin.one).\n\n[Bytecoin Android Wallet by Freewallet](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bcn.org.freewallet.app&hl=en).\n \n[Bytecoin Android Wallet by Cryptonator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aev.cryptonator&hl=en). \n\nChoose the best option that is suitable for you. Please, note that your wallet is where you store your funds. Take it seriously, use all the available protection methods (backups, mnemonics, 2FA, difficult passwords), but rely mostly on yourself and never forget your app credentials (keep them someplace safe besides your memory).\n\n**Are there any local communities presented in my native language?**\n\nBytecoin is a cryptocurrency with supporters all over the world.

We have already opened a [TRON Help Group](https://t.me/joinchat/IN2p-BK-bWl1zSbN7L5zEQ) at Telegram to answer questions related to the Tron main net. \n\n\nWe will also be pooling our collective knowledge for the rest of the SR community, and we will publish that information in a public git repository, and potentially merge that information with the official Tron documentation project, which could use some contributions.  \n\n\nOur social media circles will overlap and we will create shared MeetUps to include supporters of both groups. We are not going to let this devolve into the type of civil war that a typical political primary campaign turns into.\n\n\nAfter the first round of elections we will ascertain if it's necessary to vote strategically, pooling our votes for one group on the first day, then voting for the other group the next day.\n\nCommunity Node's goal is to stay in SR rotation however infrequently, to build block production stats which elevates the potential for more votes and establishes this SR as a reliable node for when Tron possibility decides to increase the number of Super Representative nodes.\n\nIt is our intention that this alliance will strengthen the Tron community and the SR candidates in particular.\n\n\n",

        "post_body": "Its time to recognise and somewhat quantify that Stellar is incredibly undervalued. As the Stellar Development Foundation keeps saying, sending money should be as quick and easy (and cheap) as sending an email. The Stellar network therefore acts like a telecommunications network except it primarily relays payments between nodes rather than information. \n\n[Metcalfe\u2019s Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe%27s_law) states that the value of a telecommunications network is proportional to the square of the number of users connected to the system. I.e. The more nodes (end users and or validators) there are the greater the value of the network, with its value rising exponentially. Unlike telecommunications networks the limitations for connecting nodes would be things like language barriers, bandwidth strength etc These don\u2019t apply to Stellar since all nodes connect using the stellar protocol which is one language and bandwidth is not a big factor since it only relays small byte sized packets of information to broadcast the transaction.\n\nMetcalfe\u2019s Law can be applied to transaction per day of a given network. While I don\u2019t have the figures for the number of transaction per day on the 1st March 2017 I can confidently say that they are a lot less than today?\n\nThe same Law can be applied to partnerships, developers, investors and speculators and users- they have all substantially increased harmoniously as a result of the increasing network effect. Networks such as Stellar and its native currency Lumen does seem to follow Metcalf\u2019s Law often entering price bubbles which inflate due to promise and development (fundamentals) and then spikes beyond its fundamentals due to over zealous speculation and sentiment causing the bubble to burst. The cycle is then repeated when the fundamentals catch up with new low price and sentiment then reflects what is seen as an undervalued network and the bubble starts again. This is clearly evident with [bitcoin and ethereum](https://www.trustnodes.com/2017/06/25/bitcoin-ethereum-follow-metcalfes-law-network-effects-new-study-says) but due to their POW and mining, they are affected by [Moore's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law) in my opinion and I see this as a hindrance to them long term.\n\nMetcalfe\u2019s Law is not predictive but it does give a rough guideline on the value of a network from its utility and network effect through out its development. However, if you combine Metcalfe\u2019s Law with the given network fulfilling a need to solve a social/economic problem in society as Stellar is trying to do then it becomes all the more valuable and this results in future price bubbles and exponentially higher prices.",

I'm focusing on the fundamentals right now, like what is a Blockchain and all that, and how mining works etc. \n\nBut obviously a significant topic of conversation at the moment is the bitcoin coin split. I've read about this topic too, of course, but I'm finding the things I've read don't seem to square with the massive amount of hate that seems to exist between the two camps. I go to this subreddit and it's pretty open disdain for those who support BCH and I go to r/btc and it's vice versa. \n\nI'm trying to understand the mutual hatred here. A technical change like a fork and a decision between bigger and smaller blocks doesn't seem like something that would necessarily infused with such mutual hatred.... but here we are.\n\nTo try and understand this a bit more - including the politics behind the divide - does anyone have any articles they've come across that they have found explains the issue well? Even if it is one-sided, if it defends its position we'll, I'd still be interested in reading it, while keeping in mind the bias of the writer.\n\nI'm just trying to understand the situation more, so any link to articles you have found helpful would be much appreciated!!\n\nEdit 1: Holy crap!  This blew up! I'm in Korea (cryptocurrencies are big here!!) at the moment, and woke up to a veritable gold mine of information here, so I'm just getting to work through all the comments that were added since last night now!  So trust me; I'm making my way through all of this!  \n\nI also want to say - for such a contentious topic (where it is clear there is a lot of history and where many of you have thrown in with one lot or the other) - thank you for keeping things civil here, as well as doing your best to help a person new to all this inform himself.  Sometimes, from the outside looking in, the 'big-blocker vs. small-blocker' dispute seems a bit like the United Atheist Alliance going to war against the Allied Athiest Alliance, so I greatly appreciated the opportunity you have all given me to inform myself and come to my own evaluation of what is going on. So again, thank you.   I didn't expect a response quite this awesome, and I think the fact that there is so much here is a testament to how good this community really is. At this point, the thread has taken on a life of its own, and I feel that as bitcoin and cryptomarkets grow, this thread is going to help quite a few of us curious souls new to all this wandering in from the cold.  \n\nSo again, to everyone who took the time to contribute here, thank you, and may Satoshi him(her?)-self smile upon your good fortune.\n\nEdit 2: I would also just like to say two more quick things.  First, I hope you don't mind if I ask questions below to some of you in places where I am a bit unclear about things.  And second, I'm just going to preemptively reiterate: I am new to all this, and am not on any one 'side'; in my questions I may make statements as I attempt to clarify things for myself, and those statements may either be supporting or attacking your 'side', but that is only because I'm trying to understand, and not because I am actually on one 'side' or the other.",

        "post_body": "The crypto space right now is starting to remind me of the dot com bubble all over again.\n\n--Huge amounts of money are flowing into projects with no real world use case and no real world market demand. (There is a coin called Dentacoin which is a \"coin for dentists\" that has a 20+ million dollar valuation)\n\n--Copy/paste projects are getting hundred million dollar valuations (Hshare, Bitcoin Gold)\n\n--There are at least two known scams in BitConnect and Tether (and probably 5x this amount of unknown scams)\n\nOne central tenant of chaos theory is that exponential growth can never be sustained.  People are getting in to get rich and cheer for the moon rather than actually wanting to use crypto in their every day life and start a revolution. Cryptocurrency was designed as e-cash, not a \"store of value.\" Something that can be hacked, phished, and has 100% annualized volatility is NOT a long term store of value.\n\nThis could continue and go much higher for all of 2018 but eventually there's going to be a nasty crash. The good news is, crypto, like the tech sector, will have a few projects rise out of the ashes and continue to see incredible growth.\n\nI expect the entire space to correct sharply with many coins never recovering --  What coins/qualities do people think will make for the next Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google of the crypto world?\n\nOff the top of my head:\n\n1. Governance -- It's why we're all here.  If you're in crypto for the long haul it's because you want control over your own money (not the Fed, Core, or Roger/Jihan pulling the levers for you).\n\n2. Speed/Costs -- Coins need to actually be useful as e-cash and be able to scale/get used in transactions. Lightning Network is a really cool technology but I'm not sure it's the be all/end all panacea people claim it is.  Putting all your eggs into L/N as a solution is highly risky.  If we can't beat Western Union ($5 and instant) then there's no reason to be here.\n\n3. Simple, secure, and trustworthy -- The dev team needs to be extremely trustworthy.  Pre-mined coins like Ripple will be scrutinized much more than they currently are.\n\n4. Environment Friendly -- We are already seeing this with the attention NXT is getting because it's a proof of stake coin and Ethereum looking into moving to PoS.\n\n5. Real world use cases -- For example, Monero and Zcash being used as untraceable currencies. These will certainly survive any crash because of it.\n\nIs there anything I'm missing?  What would be your 4 coins like the \"FANG stocks\" that will rise from the ashes and continue their growth?\n\nGiven the above list, the only two coins I see that fit the bill are Ethereum and Decred.",

Currently there are plenty reasons why this could be the case. The most likely ones: Wallet not synced (see sync speedup FAQ), corrupted DB (try rebuilding index via wallet menu), firewall prevents sync (grant wallet access in windows firewall). Try to re-install the client or switch to another wallet (e.g. NEO web or OTCGO web). A more user-friendly light weighted wallet is on the way (CoZ Electron Wallet).

        "post_body": "I'm writing this post because I am tired of people attempting to equate Monero's features with criminal endeavors. It is an unacceptable prejudice that I see being raised against Monero time and time again, and I will explain below the reasons why privacy matters in completely lawful ways.\n\nI'd also like to make it very clear that I have not, nor am I ever interested in committing or facilitating any sort of crime with Monero, and yet I am super passionate about Monero \u2013 who would have thought? What i'm saying is, that it's perfectly ok to desire privacy as a good Samaritan, and people should not feel ashamed or guilty for wanting privacy over their finances.\n\nI have conducted a few transactions with Bitcoin, and part of this process has been to check for confirmations to come through before the transaction can be considered 'complete'. Being the curious and bored person that I am, I have had a look at the originating Bitcoin address of the person whom I was transacting with and could see their BTC balance in broad daylight. The problem with this is that you then know their Net worth (at least in BTC) and sometimes they have had quite a lot of money.\n\nThe issue here is if the other person personally knows you during a transaction, or can get any sort of  information on you, or if you provide a residential address for shipping etc. \u2013 you could quite potentially have them use this against you for personal gain. It doesn't matter If you have $100 or $100,000k  \u2013 if somebody can find personal information by researching about you, or you provide your home address for postage \u2013 then they could potentially target you in order to rob you of said Bitcoins. \n\nA criminal could rob you in the night at gunpoint, demanding  access and possession over your Bitcoins \u201cor else you get it!\u201d. This is a very dangerous situation that people should have the right to protect themselves from. I felt really uncomfortable about this and stopped transacting ever since.\n\nI don't see how people with high Bitcoin balances can feel safe transacting with anybody whom they might already know, or for something that will be shipped to their residential address. Even if the only information they are provided is a username, more information can be dug up over the Internet. \n\nAlso privacy is a basic human right. I don't want people watching me jerk off, take a shit, going through my personal belongings, or looking into my house through the windows watching me eat dinner at night. I also don't go handing out my bank statements like candy to friends or post them on the Internet.\n\nI also don't want to get paid by somebody in Bitcoin, only to find out later on that they were  Bitcoins associated with a history of crime. If an exchange black-lists this Bitcoin then they are harder to sell (or depreciate in value) and that is not fair. What if they are seized from you? What are consumer protections for this kind of scenario? Are people expected to do their own chain analysis before doing any sort of transacting?\n\nPeople should be able to feel safe when transacting in crypto-currency, not paranoid that people can see their net worth and have a target over their heads as a result. People do crazy things for money and is thus why most people keep their net-worth and possessions private from prying eyes.\n\nYou don't put up a flashing neon sign on the roof of your house saying \u201cmy wife owns $50,000 in jewelery, i'm telling you this because privacy is a crime\u201d. \n\nThese are all points that cannot be swept under the rug. **Please do not be made to feel guilty about privacy because privacy is simply safety. Safety for you and your family.**\n\nThank you.",

        "post_body": "Let's start by saying that I am and have been a devoted NEO user and an early supporter of various projects employed on the platform. I am not trying to discredit this project, just trying to express my opinion about the direction in which the platform should continue improving. With that out of the way, let's go:\n\n1.  Problem: The number of transactions per block is capped at 500 (or a theoretical maximum of 33 tps [transactions per second]). Making Da Hong Fei's claim regarding \"1000 tps\" as valid as a similar potential claim by a member of Bitcoin Core (Bitcoin caps each block at 1Mb).\nSolution: Unfortunately, a solution to this issue is a compromise between scalability and decentralization.\n\n2. Problem: Each block header contains a multisig [multiple signature] entry as a proof of consensus. The size of a multisig is proportional to the number of signing bookkeeper nodes (minimum threshold is equal to 2n/3 + 1), with a seven-key multisig being equal to roughly 570 bytes. Making an assumption that a block is produced every 20 seconds on average, we can estimate that the multisigs consume almost 900Mb of data per year, which impacts decentralization in a negative way. Large block header size leads to fewer users being incentivized to run light nodes, as well as SPV (simple payment verification) being less accessible, contributing to an inferior overall security.\nSolution: Blockstream's implementation of Schnorr's multisig aggregation on top of the use of ed25519 DSA (digital signature algorithm) can potentially decrease the proof of consensus tenfold.\n\n3. Problem: No fallback mechanism implemented in the consensus protocol means that the consensus has to be hard reset when the nodes cannot reach the consensus.\nSolution: Create a list of standby bookkeepers than can propose a new block after a certain amount of time had expired without the original bookkeeper nodes producing a block (implying the synchronization of the clocks in all nodes to avoid timestamp spoofing).\n\n4. Problem: NEO's overreliance on precise timing. The consensus protocol assumes that the nodes operate with synchronized system clocks, which is only realistic in a centralized environment meaning that the consensus will become error-prone in case multiple nodes (>n/3) have their clocks unsynchronized or drifting.\nSolution: Unfortunately, despite the various proposals, no single solution has proven to be reliable in face of this issue.\n\n5. Problem: Bookkeeper nodes stop trying to reach consensus after the difference between the previous block timestamp and the current time exceeds 10 minutes.\nSolution: The protocol requires a fallback mechanism to ensure that the consensus is never stalled.\n\n6. Problem: This problem is a theoretical possibility, rather than an actual threat to the stability of the platform. Due to the fact that NEO consensus relies on bookkeeper node elections, the core team from NEO are theoretically able to collude with a few large exchanges to elect the majority of the nodes, meaning that the environment will no longer be \"trust-less\". \"Vote rigging\" is what I decided to call this attack vector.\nSolution: KYC-based (know your customer) vote. However, this solution opposes the whole essence of cryptocurrencies and blockchain.",

In my opinion it has a pretty perfect system of decentralised development/power, staking coins preventing a sudden (negative) market movement, high security through the hybrid PoW/PoS system and a predictable & transparent coin distribution, which is deflating like Bitcoin.\n\nI immediately started exchanging a significant chunk of my cryptos to decred and I'm thinking of exchanging more shortly.\n\nIt might be a strange question in a sub for this coin, but I haven't found many cons for decred yet. Are there any? http://www.coldnuke.com/pros-and-cons.php?pac=37 only shows 2 cons that I think are invalid. The only con I can imagine is that it is yet impossible or at least difficult to stake smaller amounts of decred, making it a bit of an elite coin to participate.\n\nAre there any other known cons that I should know of before I decide to buy more DCR?",

My affinity for this project has grown and I\u2019m always perplexed why the broader crypto community has failed to see Stakey in all his glory. I\u2019m a huge decred fan. For the moment I\u2019ll try to mute my bias and identify some cons.\n\nCoin Distribution \u2013 while better than most projects I still think it presents a challenge going forward.\n\nLiquidity \u2013 There is a lot of manufactured liquidity numbers in cryto. I believe dcr\u2019s volumes are closer to \u201ctrue\u201d liquidity than most, but the low numbers are a concern.\n\nCentralization \u2013 While every day there are more contributors to the project, it is clear the key decisions and leadership are still firmly in the grasp of the original development team. They are working hard on code so decisions can be made by stakeholders, but we aren\u2019t there yet.\n\nProject Fund Control \u2013 Politeia is almost out the door but it\u2019s my understanding project funds will still remain under human control. This requires stakeholders to put trust in that person(s).\n\nDevelopment Pace \u2013 Good devs are hard to find and like every other project in crypto there aren\u2019t enough of them. In time decred should win out here because of the project fund.\n\nProject Fund Focus \u2013 Here\u2019s where I\u2019ll get some heat. When I initially conceptualized the project fund uses I assumed the community would see this as a resource to benefit decred specifically. To date the founders have been ultra conservative with project fund expenditures which is awesome. I thought the purse strings would loosen up when pi went live but not significantly. Now I\u2019m more informed and it is clear there will be no bounds to it\u2019s use. An example is the decentralized exchange proposal that is forthcoming. The dex will be a significant expenditure burdened by this community but it will be coin agnostic with its benefits. Thus far the dex is being supported by the most influential members of the community, so it will easily pass a vote. As an investor I would not assume the project fund will be used as a resource to directly benefit decred. It will be spent wherever the stakeholders decide to spend it."

CoZ has always maintained and developed two open APIs: neon-db and neoscan, those have been used by all NEO wallets to develop their product, some currently have spin their own server of those as like all CoZ do this is open source.\n\n**Wallet developers**: we will implement anti DDoS measures starting today and this can impact connectivity for the next two days. If you are using our APIs this is a good moment to spin your own servers.\n\n**Users**: there is **zero** effect of this on the blockchain itself, this is a public service consumed by light wallets and maintained by CoZ, not related to block generation or performance of the network.\n\n\nWe are sorry that such jerks exists and we are implementing solutions.\n\n**UPDATE 16-MAY-2018** several improvements have been deployed already and others are in the pipeline. Improvements will be made both on client side (new NEON versions) and on the API side (transparent to users).",

As with my first ICO venture (Ethereum), my intuition said that something was different and exciting about this project.\n\nThere has been no shortage of concerns raised during the ICO and in the time since.  From Patrick's past, to team competency, and ICO issues due to China's political decisions.\n\nI just want to point out the following reasons why my belief in this team is at an all-time high:\n\n1. The team has adhered to the proposed strategy and the projected milestones have been met again and again.  \n\n2.  In just a short period of time the team has proven their ability to produce timely AND effective results.\n\n3.  The team adapted to the ICO issues based on the situation with China.  For example, ICO365 would not release tokens I purchased during the ICO and actually shut down the site.  The team solved the problem by sending myself and others ALL of the tokens we would've otherwise lost.  I've had a unresolved support ticket for a simple issue in with Coinbase for about 5 weeks, but the QTUM team support came in less then a week.  Amazing.\n\n4. The team had a plan and has taken action on multiple fronts.  The ICO, the releases, public speaking, all supporting websites, the swap, the investor relations... you name it, they have it covered.  \n\n5. There is a plan, but when the plan meets unexpected obstacles, the team quickly and cleverly adapts and overcomes the situation. That is the hallmark of a team and a project worth following.\n\n...IMHO...",

Right now we are all concerned with ICOs and tokens which could be considered securities. Most of us see it as a *bad* thing, we don't want any SEC interference or over regulation. But that could be just what crypto needs for its next wave.\n\n>I met with top executives of the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ\u2026 top hedge fund managers\u2026 and leaders in the blockchain industry. They are all focused on the same thing: the creation of the security token industry.\n\n>Security tokens are regulated financial securities \u2013 like traditional stocks and bonds \u2013 that provide token-holders with ownership interests in the underlying company or asset.\n\nCombining crypto tokens with securities seems to offer the best of both worlds: A platform for initial offerings that caters to the small business, with fractionalized holdings. As the author sees it, Wall Street IPO's are broken, dysfunctional, and cater to the businesses who need it the least.\n\nHow big will the security token industry be?\n\n>Ralph Daiuto, general counsel and chief operating officer of tZero (Overstock\u2019s crypto exchange), said that 100% of the stocks and bonds on Wall Street will be \u201ctokenized\u201d and traded as security tokens\u2026 probably within 24 months.\n\nThat is a head-spinning prediction. There are about 7,000 publicly traded companies in the USA. That is a lot of tokens to be created. What platforms are available for them to create their tokens? Well, there's ethereum, as we all know. And EOS, who came out of the gate a couple weeks before Tron but is having trouble reaching stability. There's Tron, of course. And I'm sure a few others, although I'm admittedly poorly researched in all of them. A search for ERC20 token migration only turned up EOS, TRX, and QRL as tokens which have moved to their own main net blockchains.\n\nThe Tron network can handle 2,000 transactions per block (every 3 seconds but can be sped up to every second), and it has the lowest transaction fees in the business. But one of the biggest differences between Tron and Ethereum when it comes to tokens is that with Ethereum tokens, the value is completely arbitrary. You can make as many ERC20 tokens you want, out of thin air. With Tron, you must create a trade-in value, so for example with Tron if you want to make a million tokens, you need to invest some TRX to give it value. It could be only 1 TRX, which makes you tokens start off nearly worthless, or you could invest 1 million TRX in creating the token, giving each token a guaranteed value of at least 1 trx. This is in addition to the 1024 TRX that is burned when you create the token contract.\n\nThis intrinsic value of Tron20 tokens, in addition to network costs and speed, could make Tron the most attractive platform for securities tokens.",

Do I need to do anything else?\" The answer is YES.\n\nIf you bought EOS from an exchange, you do not yet actually own any EOS on the final blockchain which will be created in 2018.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nYou have to do these 4 steps:\n\n1. **Transfer the coins to your own ETH wallet to which you own the private keys.** (A Ledger Nano S works for this as well.) Do not leave the EOS tokens on an exchange because you do not know with certainty that they will credit you the equivalent EOS tokens on the real EOS blockchain when it has been created in 2018.\n\n2. **Generate an EOS address** (for the actual EOS blockchain). It's on a github page here: https://nadejde.github.io/eos-token-sale/\n\n3. **Execute the 'register' function** from the EOS smart contract, to link your ETH address to your future EOS address (the one you made in step 2 above).  \nFull instructions here: http://support.exodus.io/knowledge_base/topics/ive-received-eos-tokens-in-exodus-how-do-i-register-them  \n(Note: If you stored your EOS ERC-20 tokens on a Ledger Nano S then you will have to use MyEtherWallet.com to execute the contract functions.)\n\n4. **Verify you set up everything correctly by executing the 'keys' function** from the EOS smart contract. (see details on how to do this in the above link as well, about 3/4th of the way down the article). This proves your future EOS key (the one you generated in step 2 above) is correctly linked to the EOS ERC-20 tokens that will be used at the time of the snapshot.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nYou must do the above steps, in that order, or you won't have any EOS on the actual EOS chain when it gets created in 2018.\n\nNote: You have a lot of time (until around mid-2018) to figure this out and do the steps above.",

I see time that needs to go in to parts of this project, but not being able to draw enough developers due to funding. Let's be honest, hardly anyone is going to invest time and resources into a project without having any kind of economic incentive. Some will, but it will be here and there when they have time. We all do things we would rather not do to make money, so that we can pay our bills, eat food, have a home, etc. These are needs for survival. This is the only thing that worries me with community driven coins. Don't get me wrong, love the idea, but the survival has a lot of hurdles to get over. \n\nMy solution:\n\nGhandi said, \"Be the change you want to see in the world.\" So I am putting my ideals where my money is. I am contemplating donating \"a percentage\" of all the BTCP I get from this fork to the development of BTCP. \n\nI left \"a percentage\" in there because I have not fully decided on an amount. This decision will be based off of community interest, involvement. I'm not going to be the guy pumping money in to it to only see it dump and go stagnant like ZClassic did after a while. I want this to survive and thrive. And I am willing to provide funding to motivated developers. To my knowledge, the devs already have a donation fund set up, so that won't be a problem.  \n\nPlease, share your thoughts. This is something I am considering, so if you think this is an idea that can work, please share, respond, tweet, whatever. The community needs to see how strong we are united.\n\nThank you in advance.     \n\n  ",

No matter what you call it (dip, correction, 'crash') it happened less than one week ago. Crypto in general is still in it's very early infancy stage so yes, this does look like a big deal.\n\nHowever, in 3 weeks this 5 day period will be a blip on the radar. In 3 months you may look at the charts and not even be able to tell this happened. \n\nStellar is one of the, if not the, strongest companies in crypto. It has arguably the best team, most influential partnerships and the most potential looking forward. This isn't a 'IMO', this is just the facts. As more companies adopt Stellar, it's only going to get stronger. Price will reflect this. \n\nJust keep that all in mind.\n\n",

        "post_body": "1: **XRP is a speculative purchase.** This is not a bad thing or a good thing, it just is. Nobody's really using it. I think they will someday. Therefore the price is not dictated by supply and demand. Certainly, speculative purchases create what demand there is, but that's not need-to-use industry demand. This is why \"good news doesn't move the price\" or even \"drops\" the price, because the price isn't usually moving rationally based on news. We all secretly know there are literally zero customers who have an innate need to purchase XRP to survive or compete - yet. So we're all in the same speculative boat trying to sell to each other. \n\n2: If and when industry demand fires up, **XRP price will be dictated chiefly by industry usage, and not just speculation.** \n\n3: **Industry adoption will presumably start with smaller remittance institutions.** People are acting like Ripple admitting that the Big Banks aren't target#1 is a bad thing. That's a good thing. The big banks are already making money. The smaller guys doing international remittance need to make ends meet. They need XRP.\n\n4: **We're not going to decouple from Bitcoin until industry is driving price.** No need to ask or request roadmaps on how we'll decouple. Right now both Bitcoin and XRP and nearly every other coin are just free-floating in a speculative market, so there's no reason not to swap freely between them. As soon as one price moves, bots swiftly move in to profit off of the spread. As soon as XRP goes up or down compared to BTC/USD/USDT/ETH/whatever, the bots probably sell to reap the fractions-of-a-cent difference, which buffers whatever difference there is between coins within minutes to hours. \n\n5:  **Whales?** Yeah they're manipulating price right now but they're doing so in that free-floating context of a purely speculative market. Once industry drives demand, whales will be BTFO of the water, I assume; or they'll have to pursue other speculative coin markets, assuming that's still profitable in a post-blockchain-adoption world; or they'll become liquidity providers for the xRapid network, should that be profitable enough. \n\n6: **This is gonna get downvoted as FUD**, but I don't think it qualifies. There's no fear, uncertainty, or doubt in my mind here. If anything all of this, and Ripple's tweets and statements to this effect, solidify in my mind that this is a real project that stands a real chance of adoption, which means: \n\n7: **The time to accumulate XRP is this year.**",

        "post_body": "So I'm a rational, long term crypto investor. I believe in the space and I believe that despite pump n dumps and bubbles that form, that truly great platforms, coins and tokens will come out of the ashes and persevere (like FAANG after the .com bubble).\n\nSo when I look to open a new long position, I always come in as a skeptic and try to be convinced otherwise by doing my due diligence and discussing with people in those communities. Oftentimes those people get defensive and irrational in their predictions (I'm often told someone's favorite coin will be worth more than the USA GDP without them realizing it), but sometimes it sparks very helpful and constructive discussions - those ones typically are the best investments.\n\nSo...my eyes have been on TRX for some time now. I keep considering opening a position, but some things stop me:\n\n1) Current valuation - $2.5 billion feels high at this stage in the game. While the concept is great, what is the justification for this to go to, say, $10 billion (16 cents I believe)? \n\n2) Proprietary qualities - I love the concept and the philosophy here, but I fail to see what about the tech will give it a competitive advantage over its peers. What will stop anyone else from pushing TRX out at their own game? Why wouldn't Facebook and Google see this idea and say \"hey, we can compensate people for their data as well\"?\n\n3) Leadership. This one is interesting because everyone says the CEO is a major reason they're investing. Then when asked why, I often see comments like \"he was in Forbes\" or \"he seems like a legit guy\". To me these aren't great answers, and I've often seen that when creators of coins are the most vocal they are typically the most self interested vs passionate for their product. I always was impressed with Charlie Lee's approach of downplaying Litecoin while urging people not to buy at the highs and lose their money \"since the people who buy at highs are the ones who can afford it the least\". Maybe it's just great marketing by Charlie, but I bought his passion for crypto.\n\n\nSo these are my big hesitations. Typically my rule is to never buy during major bull runs and always wait for a dip and settle. I do see the momentum of TRX continuing short term, but I'd love some input from the community on its long term sustainability. Once I pick a coin, I stick with it and become a vocal and active supporter, so hopefully this can spark some good conversation that eases my concerns and I hope on board.\n\nThanks in advance for an informative discussion,\n\nK",

It's just a matter of if they do or not. \n\n3) Justin Sun already created a multi million dollar company. Instead of applying to Hupan university he was invited. Hupan university admissions requirements was you had to have a business at least 3 years old with 30 employees and at least 4.5 million dollars of annual revenue. If you think Jack Ma is a great leader the him inviting Justin Sun to attend his university says a lot about the type of leadership Justin possesses. \n\nJustin is an entrepreneur through and through.

        "post_body": "Every time I read a post about main net launch I see a comment about how the price will go up to 15, 20, 25$. This is simply not how it's going to go and we all need to realize this now and not on the 25th. The efficient market hypothesis states that all known information about ICX is already factored into the price. People already know Mainnet is coming out, people who believe that Mainnet increases the value have already bought based on that information.\n\nThe only thing that will change the value of ICX is 1. global market cap changes (if we go back to 800 billion, it will rise in price with everything else, possibly slightly moreso than others). OR 2. Some new piece of information arises.   Say Mainnet launch happens and is a huge success causing new information to come forth such as partnerships or advisors coming on board, then you can expect the value to increase. Mainnet could also get postponed or be disappointing, then you can expect the value to decrease. \n\nAll this to say that Mainnet means nothing for the value of the coin. It means everything to the technology however, and you should still be very excited about it. I'm proud to say ICX is my largest %HODL, but I do not expect Mainnet to increase the value. If anything the value will drop because so many are expecting moons out of this.  If you're just in this for Mainnet--> Moon--> Sell, you may as well get out now.  Not trying to spread FUD, still very bullish on ICX, just my take on this situation. If you disagree, I'd love to hear your thoughts.",

Bank's don't want to come out looking irresponsible.\n\nAnd Ripple obviously know this. Which is why they are focusing on Payment Providers for now like Moneygram, western union, Mercury FX etc. If you can catch the low hanging fruits and show cost savings.\n\nIt becomes easier for banks to see value and evaluate risks and push for positive regulation.\n\nAnd every central bank is looking at regulating Cryptos. So sooner or later there will be regulations. And when that happen's XRP will be available for use. Ready and tested.\n\nTo declare banks 'Don't want the currency' at this point of time and therefore XRP is worthless is irresponsible journalism and clumsy analysis.\n\nWhat Ripple has is potential that few or none of the other coins currently exhibit. So I'd still say it is better to get in early while it is still cheap!",

I'm on that list of \"HUGE WINS\" a couple of times.  I should have quit there, while substantially ahead of my starting amount, but the rush and greed got me in the end.  This is easy!  I'm going to get to 10,000 EOS at this rate!\n\nOut of all those transactions, I once rolled 11 wins in a row.  Twice, I rolled 12 losses in a row.  Calculating the probability and knowing how small of a chance of these events could occur (<1%), I figured it couldn't happen, could it?  Well, two runs of 12 consecutive losses wiped me out by 73%.  I should have stopped after the first major loss but no, it was just a matter of time before I'd win it back. <smh>\n\nThe strange thing is, before this game, I've never really gambled in any substantial manner.  I've bought a lottery ticket when the payout is several million, spent $20 at a casino a couple of times, but the ease of which I could spend EOS really got me.\n\nI'm not blaming anyone but my lack of self-control. This Saturday has been a complete wreck for me and I have become physically ill.  It even crossed my mind to try again but I decided on this reddit post instead.  Now I just have to hope EOS increases in value to cover my initial fiat deposit and hope that the BET Dividends are a real thing because, boy, do I now have a lot of BET Tokens!\n\n**SET A LIMIT, STAY WITHIN IN!**",

We will be trying to do this every few weeks as we don\u2019t always have large announcements or videos for release, but feel it\u2019s important that the community know what\u2019s going on behind the scenes where possible.\n\n**South Africa**\n\nAs our first implementation, South Africa has been essential in not only highlighting improvements, but also in providing a proof of concept for other partners and regions moving forward. We have a range of internal targets for the trial with the Unlimited, and all of them have been smashed within our first 2 months.\n\nOur team on the ground in SA was received with an incredible amount of excitement and enthusiasm by both local vendors and users. If you haven\u2019t already been watching our twitter updates, I strongly urge you to go check them out:\n\n[https://twitter.com/Electroneum\\_SA](https://twitter.com/Electroneum_SA)\n\nAs mentioned in Rich\u2019s recent video, our trial in SA has led to us reworking the onboarding process (i.e. how easy it is to sign up and start using the phone app). This is now a sleek 60 second process that we are confident will make it both easier and more appealing to potential users. We will announce on social media when the update has finished testing and is ready for release and look to provide some more in depth information on South Africa when its ready.\n\n**Support Help desk**\n\nLast year we received over 50,000 support tickets by users; an average of one every 10 minutes. With that in mind, and in preparation for our expected growth, we have been reviewing the support desk and seeing how it can be improved.\n\nAs previously announced, we moved to a new system (Zendesk) last week which enabled better transparency and monitoring our end.  As part of this, we are also opening up Live Chat support to users which will run during working hours (Mon-Fri 09:00 \u2013 17:00 BST).\n\nService users will now be able to register a support account and login at [https://support.electroneum.com](https://support.electroneum.com) to speak to a representative direct.

He's doing his damn best to explain things in English to everyone, and people are just insulting his attempt to do so. Also the fact that he's not just saying buzzwords... he's doing his best to be super forward facing to his backers. You can hear that he's genuine in his inflections.\n\nAlso, this is a very informal, Periscope stream. If anyone actually thought he'd have a Powerpoint or shit like that to be seen, you all greatly misunderstood what his plan was for tonight.\n\n**For anyone who wants to read the disorganized transcript of the Livestream, courtiously done by btcrazy as fast as he could, you can find that post here: [ROUGH TRANSCRIPT](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tronix/comments/7ogk2z/rough_transcription_of_the_livestream/)**\n\n\n\n**GENERAL**\n\n* Stream is dedicated to the Vision of Tron, his background, and Investors Backgrounds.\n\n**PERSONAL**\n\n* He is considering turning over control of PeiWo and moving to SanFrancisco to fully devote his time to Tron as he has the confidence they can handle PeiWo from where they are at.\n\n**PARTNERSHIPS**\n\n* Partnerships with a large social facing company such as Facebook, Tenecent (WeChat), etc clearly won't be the partner announcement, as he spent a decent amount of time talking about how he doesn't like the way they treat the users.\n* [Bitmain](https://www.bitmain.com/) Partnership - Largest Bitcoin Miner Company in China\n* [oBike](https://www.o.bike/) Partnership\n* [Gifto](https://gifto.io/) Partnership - He's on their Board of Directors and the company was Created by the founders of Up.Live. Gifto will be releasing a new coin on their network (believed to be Tron right now) (More information about Gifto [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tronix/comments/7ogj31/takeaways_from_justins_livestream/ds9dk48/))\n\n**TRON PLATFORM**\n\n* Decentralized internet platform that stops all the data aggregation and rewards the content creators instead of the companies that host the platform itself.\n* Your private key will be your Login to all TRX Apps, ultimately allowing your accounts to be as secure as your current crypto investments.\n\n**TRON PIPELINE**\n\n* Hired 10 people last week on the application integration\n* At least 5 NASDAQ Public listed companies are partnered with them, but due to their own discretion, will be annouced at a later time by both parties.\n* With these major new partnerships, these need to be finalized and that takes time, so everyone should be patient while these announcements roll out\n\n**TRON DOGS**\n\n* Year of the Puppy(Dog) hence the point of making the initial launch of pets focused on TRON Dogs. The game is still being fleshed out with many other features.\n\n**TEAM MEMBERS**\n\n* I won't lie, I understood the function of the people he was talking about, and they have great backgrounds, but I won't make a half-assed attempt to write their names here. If anyone can speak about this, the information was definitely present in the stream.\n* People from Microsoft, Alibaba, JD and PKU have joined the team. If anyone can list these names and what he said their part is in this below, I will gladly add to the post.\n\n**TRON GIVEAWAY**\n\n* 5 Individuals who re-tweeted during the stream will be awarded 80 TRON, which was set by their marketing beforehand. He hopes by next stream to greatly increase this amount.\n\n\n\n**LASTLY, Periscope crashed, so he is having an AMA to the best of his abilites here:**\nhttps://twitter.com/justinsuntron/status/949475975229685760\n\n*[Permalink](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tronix/comments/7ogj31/takeaways_from_justins_livestream/ds9fp7m/) about my Wife who speaks Mandarin watching his Mandarin stream.*  \n\n\n*There will be rolling edits to this post as more accurate information that was missed is collected.*  \n\n*[LINK](https://weibo.com/tv/l/JFSzPy7319YnH2QW) - This is his stream in Mandarin incase anyone wants to see.*",

        "post_title": "TRXDEX is it legit?",
        "post_body": "Hello everyone. I\u2019ve been part of the TrxDex \u201cteam\u201d until today. I had to quit being involved with TrxDex after the episode this morning when Reinhard (the only person in charge of TrxDex) invoked the 5th AML (anti-money laundering) directive passed on May 30th 2018 as a reason to not give TrxDex voters their rightful TRX rewards.\n\nI would like to dive into what the 5th AML Directive has to say about cryptocurrencies (which will only go in effect in 2020!!!):\n\n\u201cProviders engaged in exchange services **between virtual currencies and fiat currencies** (that is to say coins and banknotes that are designated as legal tender and electronic money, of a country, accepted as a medium of exchange in the issuing country) as well as **custodian wallet providers** are under no Union obligation to identify suspicious activity. Therefore, terrorist groups may be able to transfer money into the Union financial system or within virtual currency networks by concealing transfers or by benefiting from a certain degree of anonymity on those platforms. It is therefore essential to extend the scope of Directive (EU) 2015/849 so as to include providers engaged in exchange services between virtual currencies and fiat currencies as well as custodian wallet providers. For the purposes of anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT), competent authorities should be able, through obliged entities, to monitor the use of virtual currencies. Such monitoring would provide a balanced and proportional approach, safeguarding technical advances and the high degree of transparency attained in the field of alternative finance and social entrepreneurship.\u201d\n\nThis paragraph only targets centralized exchanges and wallet providers. There is NO mention of any **airdrops** or exchange between **virtual currencies and other virtual currencies**.\n\nThe next paragraph concerning virtual currencies is:\n\n\u201cThe anonymity of virtual currencies allows their potential misuse for criminal purposes. The inclusion of providers engaged in exchange services between **virtual currencies and fiat currencies and custodian wallet providers** will not entirely address the issue of anonymity attached to virtual currency transactions, as a large part of the virtual currency environment will remain anonymous because users can also transact without such providers. To combat the risks related to the anonymity, national Financial Intelligence Units (FIUs) should be able to obtain information allowing them to associate virtual currency addresses to the identity of the owner of virtual currency. In addition, the possibility to allow users to self-declare to designated authorities on a voluntary basis should be further assessed.\u201d\n\nIn this paragraph, the authorities simply address the fact that they are unable to completely monitor all transactions of virtual currencies (i.e. Decentralized Exchanges like TrxDex was supposed to be, transactions between users without any intermediary etc.) and suggest the matter should be assessed further.\n\nSource:  [https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32018L0843&from=EN](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32018L0843&from=EN)\n\nSo basically all Reinhard\u2019s arguments that the 5th AML Directive would cause legal repercussions to TrxDex are wrong and personally I consider them just an excuse to keep TRX for himself, while airdropping DEX, a currency without value, to all TrxDex Voters.\n\nWhen I asked Reinhard for proof that he talked to his \u201clawyers\u201d which advised him not to send the TRX, and also a screenshot of his discussions with the Tron Foundation regarding the matter, he played dumb and then simply stopped responding altogether. I kept insisting on him answering these questions, but he stopped writing on any of our private channels. Instead, he talked in private with Langdon (one of the other community managers) and instructed him what to say to the voters and what message to pin in the Telegram channel.\n\nAfter a while I was excluded from the TrxDex managers Telegram channel. I started telling people what happened in the main TrxDex Telegram channel, and after a while I was banned.\n\nI have nothing to gain by posting this, I am simply stating the facts. And the facts are that the TrxDex project :\n\n\\- has no Whitepaper (only some general bits written by myself and Langdon, Reinhard provided no input whatsoever\n\n\\- has no roadmap\n\n\\- has a team of 1 so called dev and an army of community managers trying to keep voters calm\n\n\\- has a broken website without any improvement in the last few weeks, which is down 50% of the time and which has a section where people can enter their actual private keys to \u201ctest\u201d the exchange. I\u2019m sure most people are wise enough not to put any of their real private keys in there, but maybe some are not so smart and actually do it.\n\n\\- There is little to no communication between Reinhard and the rest of the \u201cteam\u201d\n\n\\- Nobody from the \u201cteam\u201d knows Reinhard\u2019s real name or how he looks like. I asked him several times to put his LinkedIn profile in the Whitepaper Draft or in the Telegram Channel. He read the messages and never did.\n\nSome people said I shouldn\u2019t post this because it will hurt Tron\u2019s image. Some people called me a FUDder. The truth is, I don\u2019t really care. I\u2019m doing the right thing and that\u2019s all that matters to me.\n\nYou want a true democracy in the SR elections? Then this type of information should reach the people voting for TrxDex. And then, they can make their own decision if they want to continue voting or not. I actually believe that this will prove one of two things:\n\n1. Either voters will penalize unprofessional SRs who try to deceive them by invoking irrelevant regulation.\n2. Or they will disregard all the information, mark it as \u201cFUD\u201d and continue voting hoping they will get rich by owning 5M DEX.\n\nTime will tell. I did my job. Good luck TrxDex voters. Good luck Tron !!\n\n\\-----\n\nEDIT:\n\nI forgot to mention TrxDexs' new plan of giving only DEX to all voters in the future, and then giving TRX out in trading competitions when the exchange launches (if it launches). Reinhard is basically giving all voters DEX which has 0 value, and keeping all the TRX which has some value for himself. All of this, to keep people voting for him until the end of August so he can stockpile all the TRX he can and then simply vanish without a trace.\n\nHow does that sound, ey?",

        "post_body": "**Last updated: May 30, 2018: Updated wallet info with release of Trinity.\n\nThis 4 part series from the IOTA foundation covers most of the technical FUD centered at IOTA. \n\nhttps://blog.iota.org/official-iota-foundation-response-to-the-digital-currency-initiative-at-the-mit-media-lab-part-1-72434583a2\n\nAlso the [official IOTA faq](https://www.iota.org/get-started/faqs) on iota.org answers nearly all of these questions if you want to hear the answers directly.\n\n**Purpose of Writing**\n\nSince posting FUD is so ridiculously low-effort in comparison to setting the record straight, I felt it necessary to put a log of copy-pastas together to balance the scales so its just as easy to answer the FUD as it was to generate it. So next time you hear someone say \"IOTA is centralized\", you no longer have to take an hour out of your day and spin your wheels with someone who likely had an agenda to begin with. You just copy-paste away and move on. \n\nIt's also worth mentioning IOTA devs are too damn busy working on the protocol and doing their job to answer FUD. So I felt a semblance of responsibility.\n\nHere they are. These answers are too my understanding so if you see something that doesn't look right let me know! They are divided into the following categories so if you are interested in a specific aspect of IOTA you can scroll to that section.\n\n1) WALLET\n\n2) COMMUNITY\n\n3) INVESTING\n\n4) TECHNICAL\n\n**************\n\n#WALLET\n\n##IOTA was hacked and users funds were stolen!\n\nFirst, IOTA was not hacked. The term \u201chacked\u201d is thrown around way too brazingly nowadays and often used to describe events that weren\u2019t hacks to begin with. Its a symptom of this space growing way too fast creating situations of the blind leading the blind and causing hysteria. \n\nWhat happened: \n\nMany IOTA users trusted a certain 3rd party website to create their seed for their wallets. This website silently sent copies of all the seeds generated to an email address and waited till it felt it had enough funds, then it took everyones money simultaneously. That was the \u201dhack\u201d. \n\nhttps://blog.iota.org/the-secret-to-security-is-secrecy-d32b5b7f25ef\n\nThe lesson: \n\nThe absolute #1 marketed feature of crypto is that  **you are your own bank**. Of everything that is common knowledge about crypto, this is at the top. But being your own bank means you are responsible for the security of your own funds. There is no safety net or centralized system in place that is going to bail you out. \n\nFor those that don\u2019t know (and you really should if you\u2019ve invested in anything crypto), your seed is your username-pw-security question-backup email all rolled into one. Would you trust a no-name 3rd party website to produce your username+pw for your bank account? Because thats essentially what users did.\n\nThe fix:\n\nMake your seed offline with the generators in the sidebar or use dice. This is outlined in the \u201chow to generate wallet and seed\u201d directly following. \n\nThe trinity and carriota wallets will have seed generators within them upon their release.\n\n##How to generate wallet and seed\n\n1) Download official trinity wallet [here](https://trinity.iota.org/)\n\n2) follow the instructions on the app. \n\n3) Do not run any apps in conjunction with the trinity app. Make sure all other apps are completely closed out on your device. \n\n##Are you sure a computer can\u2019t just guess my seed?\n\nAn IOTA seed is 81 characters long. There are more IOTA seed combinations than atoms in the universe. All the computers in the world combined would take ~~millions~~ billions of years just to find your randomly generated one that\u2019s located somewhere between the 0th and the 27^81st combination. The chance for someone to randomly generate the exact same seed as yours is 1 / (27^81). \n\nIf you can\u2019t fathom the number 27 ^ 81, this video should help:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8YIdmwcubc\n\n##Why is Trinity wallet taking so long!!??\n\nTrinity is out. https://trinity.iota.org/\n\n**************\n\n#COMMUNITY\n\n##IOTA introduction video to share with family\n\nhttps://youtu.be/LyC04NrJ3yA\n\n##Tangle visualizers\n\n\nhttp://tangle.glumb.de/\n\n##How to setup a full node\n\nDownload Bolero and run! Bolero is an all-in-one full node install package with the latest IOTA IRI and Nelson all under a one-click install! \n\nhttps://github.com/SemkoDev/bolero.fun/releases\n\n\"If you want to help the network then spam the network. If you **really** want to help the network then create a full node and let others spam you!\" \n\n##No questions or concerns get upvoted, only downvoted!\n\nThat\u2019s just the nature of this business. Everyone in these communities has money at stake and are extremely incentivized to keep only positive news at the top of the front page. There is nothing you're going to do about that on this subreddit or any crypto subreddit. It's just a reddit fact of life we have to deal with. Everyone has a downvote and everyone has an upvote. But what can be done is just simply answer the questions even if they are downvoted to hell. Yea most people wont' see the answers or discussion but that one person will. every little bit counts.\n\nI will say that there are most certainly answers to nearly every FUD topic out there. Every single one. A lot of the posts I'm seeing as of late especially since the price spike are rehashed from months ago. They are often not answered not because there isn't an answer/explanation, but because regulars who have the answers simply don't see them (for the reason listed above). I can see how it's easy for this to be interpreted (especially by new users) as there not being an answer or \"the FUDsters are on to something\" but thats just not the case.\n\n##Developer's candidness (aka dev's are assholes!) \n\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/Iota/comments/7obyyx/serious_talk_about_pr_system_iota_and_david/ds8ouvc\n\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/Iota/comments/7obyyx/serious_talk_about_pr_system_iota_and_david/ds8rega\n\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/Iota/comments/7oi9g8/why_is_everyone_so_critical_of_david_this_has_to/ds9rtbb\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/qb0ik4tgny401.jpg\n\nLastly and to no surprise, David conducts himself very professionally in this [interview](https://youtu.be/GwhJQ67zxbg) even when asked several tough questions about the coordinator and MIT criticism. \n\n##IOTA Devs do not respond appropriately to criticism\n\nWhen critiquers provide feedback that is ACTUALLY useful to the devs, then sure they'll be glad to hear it. So far not once has an outside dev brought up something that the IOTA devs found useful. Every single time it ends up being something that was already taken into consideration with the design and if the critiquer did an ounce of research they would know that. Thus you often find the IOTA devs dismissing their opinion as FUD and responding with hostility because all their critique is really doing is sending the message to their supporters that they are not supposed to like IOTA anymore.\n\nNick Johnson was a perfect example of this. The Ethereum community was co-existing [peacefully]with IOTA\u2019s community (as they do with nearly all alt coins) until Nick wrote his infamous article. Then almost overnight Ethereum decided it didn\u2019t like IOTA anymore and we\u2019ve been dealing with that shit since. As of today, add LTC to that list with Charlie\u2019s (even admitting) ignorant judgement of IOTA.\n\n12/17/2017: Add [John McAfee (bitcoin cash)](https://i.redd.it/rsizfpeyq5401.png) and [Peter Todd (bitcoin)](https://twitter.com/petertoddbtc/status/942206322023587840) to the list of public figures who have posted ignorantly on IOTA. \n\n##A lot of crypto communities certainly like to hate on IOTA...\n\nIOTA is disrupting the disrupters. It invented a completely new distributed ledger infrastructure (the tangle) that replaces the blockchain and solves all of its fundamental problems (namely fees and scaling). To give you an idea of this significance, 99% of the cryptocurrencies that exist are built on a block chain. These projects have billions of dollars invested into them meaning everyone in their communities are incentivized to see IOTA fail and spread as much FUD about it as possible. This includes well known organizations, public figures, and brands. Everyone commenting in these subreddits and crypto communities have their own personal money at stake and skin in the game. Misinformation campaigns, paid reddit posters, upvote/downvote bots, and corrupt moderators are all very real in this space.  \n\n\n\n**************\n\n#INVESTING\n\n##How do I buy IOTA\n\nhttps://medium.com/@fuo213/how-to-buy-iota-the-complete-guide-for-crypto-dummies-e63560caf921\n\n##What is the IOTA foundation?\n\nIOTA foundation is a non-profit established in Germany and recognized by the European Union. Blog post here: https://blog.iota.org/iota-foundation-fb61937c9a7e\n\n##How many companies and organizations are interested, partnered or actively using IOTA?\n\nA lot, and often too many to keep up with. \n\nhttps://reddit.com/r/Iota/comments/7f3dmx/list_of_known_iota_partnerships_corporate/\n\n##How was IOTA distributed?\n\nAll IOTAs that will ever exist were sold at the ICO in 2015. There was no % reserved for development. Devs had to buy in with their personal money. Community donated back 5% of all IOTA so the IOTA foundation could be setup.\n\n##No inflation schedule? No additional coins? How is this sustainable?\n\nInterestingly enough, IOTA is actually the only crypto that does not run into any problems with a currency cap and deflationaryism. Because there are zero fees, you will always be able to pay for something for exactly what it's worth using IOTA, no matter how small the value. If by chance in the future a single iota grows so large in value that it no longer allows someone to pay for something in fractions of a penny, the foundation would just add decimal points allowing for a tenth or a hundreth or a thousandth of an iota to be transacted with.\n\nTo give you some perspective, if a single IOTA equals 1 penny, IOTA would have a 27 trillion dollar market cap (100x that of Bitcoin's today) \n\n##IOTA is not for P2P, only for M2M\n\nWith the release of the trinity wallet, it's now dead simple for anyone to use IOTA funds for P2P. [Try it out](https://trinity.iota.org/).\n\n##Companies technically don\u2019t have to use the IOTA token\n\n[Yes they do](https://i.redd.it/t6gmplq0c2tz.jpg)\n\nWorth clarifying that 0 iota data transactions are perfectly fine and are welcomed since they still provide pow for 2 other transactions and help secure the network. In the early stages, these types of transactions will probably be what give us the tps/pow needed to remove the coordinator and allow the network defend 34% attacks organically.\n\nBut... if someone does not want to sell or exchange their data for free (0 IOTA transaction), then Dominic is saying that the IOTA token must be used for that or any exchange in value on the network.\n\nThis is inherently healthy for the ecosystem since it provides a neutral and non-profit middle ground that all parties/companies can trust. If one company made their own token it wouldn\u2019t be trusted since companies are incentivized by profits and nothing is stopping them from manipulating their token to make them more money. Thus, the IOTA foundation will not partner with anyone who refuses to take this option off the table.\n\n##All these companies are going to influence IOTA development!!\n\nThese companies have no influence on the development of IOTA. They either choose to use it or they don\u2019t.\n\n##Internet of things is cheap and will stay cheap\n\nInternet of things is one application of IOTA and considered by many to be the 4th industrial revolution. Go do some googling. IOTA having zero fees enables M2M for the first time in history. Also, if a crypto can do M2M it sure as shit can do M2P and P2P. M2M is hard mode.\n\n##IOTA surpassing speculation\n\nIOTA, through the data marketplace and [qubic](qubic.iota.org), will be the first crypto to surpass speculation and actually be used in the real world for something. From there, it will branch out into other use cases, such as P2P. Or maybe P2P use of IOTA will grow in parallel with M2M, because why not?\n\nhttps://blog.iota.org/iota-data-marketplace-cb6be463ac7f\n\n12/19/17 update: Bosch reinforces IOTA's break-out from speculation by buying IOTA tokens for its future use in the data marketplace. \nhttps://i.redd.it/8e5b8bi9ov401.png\n\nhttp://www.bosch-presse.de/pressportal/de/en/robert-bosch-venture-capital-makes-first-investment-in-distributed-ledger-technology-137411.html\n\n##Investing in a new project barely off the ground\n\nInvesting in a project in its early stages was something typically reserved for wealthy individuals/organizations before ICO\u2019s became a thing. With early investing comes much less hand holding and more responsibility on the user to know what they are doing. If you have a hard time accepting this responsibility, don\u2019t invest and wait for the technology to get easier for you. How many people actually knew how to use and mine bitcoin in 2009 before it had all its gui infrastructure?\n\nIOTA is a tangle, the first of its kind. NOT a copy paste blockchain. As a result wallets  and applications for IOTA are the first of their kind and translating the tangle into a nice clean user-friendly blockchain experience for the masses is even more taxing. \n\n##Why is the price of my coin falling?!\n\nThis may be the most asked question on any crypto subreddit but it's also the easiest to explain. The price typically falls when bad things happen to a coin or media fabricates bad news about a coin and a portion of investors take it seriously. The price increases when good things happen to a coin, such as a new exchange listing or a partnership announced etc.. The one piece that is often forgotten but trumps all these effects is something called \"market forces\".\n\nMarket forces is what happens to your coin when another coin gets a big news hit or a group of other coins get big news hits together. For example, when IOTA data marketplace released, IOTA hit a x5 bull run in a single week. But did you notice all the other alt coins in the red? There are a LOT of traders that are looking at the space as a whole and looking to get in on ANY bull action and will sell their other coins to do so. This effect can also be compounded over a long period of time such as what we witnessed when the bitcoin fork FOMO was going on and alt coins were squeezed continuously to feed it for weeks/months.\n\nThese examples really just scratch the surface of market forces but the big takeaway is that your coin or any coin will most certainly fall (or rise) in price at the result of what other coins are doing, with the most well known example being bitcoin\u2019s correlation to every coin on the market. If you don't want to play the market-force game or don't have time for it, then you can never go wrong buying and holding.\n\nIt's also important to note that there are layers of investors. There's a top layer of light-stepping investors that are a mixture of day traders and gamblers trying to jump in and jump out to make quick money then look for the next buying (or shorting) opportunity at another coin. There's a middle layer of buyers and holders who did their research, believe in the tech and placing their bets it will win out in the long run. And the bottom layer are the founders and devs that are in it till the bitter end and there to see the vision realized. When a coin goes on a bull run, always expect that any day the top layer is going to pack up and leave to the next coin. But the long game is all about that middle layer. That is the layer that will be giving the bear markets their price-drop resistance. That is why the meme \"HODL\" is so effective because it very elegantly simplifies this whole concept for the common joe and makes them a part of that middle layer regardless if they understand whats going on or not.\n\n*************\n\n#TECHNICAL\n\n##How is IOTA free and how does it scale\n\nIOTA is an altruistic system. Proof of work is done in IOTA just like bitcoin. Only a user\u2019s device/phone must do pow for 2 other transactions before issuing one of its own. Therefore no miners and no fees. And the network becomes faster the more transactions are posted. Because of this, spamming the network is encouraged since they provide pow for 2 other transactions and speed up the network.\n\n##IOTA is centralized\n\nIOTA is more decentralized than any blockchain crypto that relies on 5 pools of [miners](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/mining/china/), all largely based in China. Furthermore, the coordinator is not a server in the dev\u2019s basement that secretly processes all the transactions. It\u2019s several nodes all around the globe that add milestone transactions to show the direction of the IF\u2019s tangle within the DAG so people don\u2019t accidentally follow a fork from a malicious actor. Anyone with the know-how can fork the tangle right now with a double-spend. But no one would follow their fork because the coordinator reveals which tangle is the legit IF one. If the coordinator wasn\u2019t there (assuming low honest-transaction volume), there would be no way to discern which path to follow especially after the tangle diverges into forks of forks. Once throughout of honest transactions is significant enough, the \u201chonest tangle\u201d will replace the coordinated one and people will know which one to follow simply because it\u2019s the biggest one in the room. \n\nReferencing the coordinator is also [optional](https://www.reddit.com/r/Iota/comments/7717ms/at_what_point_will_iota_remove_the_validator/).\n\nAlso, if you research and understand how IOTA intends to work without the coordinator, it\u2019s easier to accept it for now as training wheels. I suggest reading pg 15 and on of the white paper analyzing in great depth how the network will defend different attack scenarios without a coordinator. For the past several months, IOTA foundation has been using St Petersburg college\u2019s super computer to stress test IOTA and learn when they can turn the coordinator off. There will likely be a blog about the results soon.\n\nThis is another great read covering double spends on IOTA without a coordinator: www.tangleblog.com/2017/07/10/is-double-spending-possible-with-iota/\n\nThis too: http://www.reddit.com/r/Iota/comments/7eix4a/any_iota_guru_that_can_explain_what_this_guy_is/dq5ijrm\n\nAlso this correspondence with Vitalik and Come_from_Beyond https://twitter.com/DavidSonstebo/status/932510087301779456\n\nAt the end of the day, outstanding claims require outstanding evidence and folks approaching IOTA with a \u201cI\u2019ll believe it when I see it\u201d attitude is completely understandable. It\u2019s all about your risk tolerance.\n\n##Can IOTA defend double spend attacks?\n\n99% of these \u201cbut did they think about double spend attacks?\u201d type questions could just be answered if people went and did their own research. Yes *of course* they thought about that. That\u2019s like crypto101\u2026\n\nwww.tangleblog.com/2017/07/10/is-double-spending-possible-with-iota/\n\n##Will IOTA have smart contracts?\n\nYes - qubic.iota.org\n\n##Trinary vs binary?\n\n\"By using a ternary number system, the amount of devices and cycles can be reduced significantly. In contrast to two-state devices, multistate devices provide better radix economy with the option for further scaling\"\n\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/srep36652\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/6jgbvb/iota_isnt_it_the_perfect_cryptocurrency/dje8os2/\n\n##Bitcoin with lightning network will make IOTA obsolete.\n\nIf you want lightning network, IOTA already released it.

Very important for businesses.\n\n##Coin privacy\n\nCentralized coin mixer is out that foundation runs. Logs are kept so they can collect data and improve it Folks can copy the coin mixer code and run it themselves. Goal is for mixer to be decentralized and ran by any node.\n\n##How do nodes scale? How on earth can all that data be stored?\n\nFull nodes store, update and verify from the last snapshot, which happens roughly every month. Its on the roadmap to make snapshotting automatic and up to each full node\u2019s discretion.With automatic snapshots, each full node will act as a partial perma-node and choose when to snapshot its tangle data. If someone wants to keep their tangle data for several months or even years, they could just choose not to snapshot. Or if they are limited on hard drive space, they could snapshot every week.\n\nPerma-nodes would store the entire history of the tangle from the genesis. These are optional and would likely only be created by companies who wish to sell historical access of the tangle as a service or companies who heavily use the tangle for their own data and want to have quick, convenient access to their data\u2019s history.\n\nSwarm nodes are also in development which will ease the burden on full nodes. https://blog.iota.org/iota-development-roadmap-74741f37ed01\n\n##Node discovery is manual?

        "post_body": "[Future of Electroneum 2 & 5 Years Goals](https://reddit.com/link/8x2eim/video/jt0cu1i9fq811/player)\n\n\u201cA creative writing teacher at San Jose State used to say about clich\u00e9s: \u2018Avoid them like the plague.\u2019 Then he'd laugh at his own joke. The class laughed along with him, but I always thought clich\u00e9s got a bum rap. Because, often, they're dead-on. But the aptness of the clich\u00e9d saying is overshadowed by the nature of the saying as a clich\u00e9. For example, \"the elephant in the room\" saying. Nothing could more correctly describe the initial moments of my reunion with Rahim Khan.\u201d \u2013The Kite Runner\n\n**While perhaps clich\u00e9, nothing could more correctly describe this moment in time than to say: There is never going to be a better time to buy some Electroneum. Here is why.**\n\nThere will come a day when we are talking about ETN in dollars, not cents. Yes, dollars. You will hear so many saying how ETN is cheap and it\u2019s a great time to get in now *after* we return to $0.20 and well above\u2026If you take 1 minute and read this through to the very end, only then will you clearly see why.\n\nLet\u2019s sum up the last 5 days\u2019 major news and developments:  **1. Electroneum Director Chris Gorman, OBE, along with the rest of the Electroneum Team have secured a top 10 exchange, Coinbene; 2. There was a perfectly executed, smooth hard fork on ETN\u2019s blockchain to finally put an end to the hash-raids; and 3. Electroneum got approved by Apple for iOS Beta.**\n\nFor those who constantly attacked Electroneum and the Team behind it, here you go. The world will now know that few stood up against many and despite all odds the good prevailed against evil.\n\nApple is one of, if not the most, critical and scrutinizing organizations for allowing any crypto the keys to its castle: The App Store. And yet, here we are: As of July 6th Apple has officially granted Electroneum access. No more can FUDsters call ETN a $hitcoin or a scam. Now, finally, ETN for everyone: Apple iPhone users will be ecstatic to hear that Apple gave its blessing on the iOS Beta. Soon you will be able to enjoy Electroneum\u2019s new App.\n\n[President & Ceo Richards Ells](https://reddit.com/link/8x2eim/video/mgwntfd2gq811/player)\n\nRight now, with this amount of news and developments (and even more massive announcements to come), the 1 question you must ask yourself is not whether this coin will fly; rather, you must only ask yourself how high?\n\n[https://twitter.com/coinbene/status/1014850882477817857](https://twitter.com/coinbene/status/1014850882477817857)\n\nCoinBene is a Singapore-based exchange with approximately $2.0 billion of trading volume, according to Coinmarketcap. Just to give you an idea how massive this is, here are some stats on the exchanges: CoinBene sits in the top position with about $2.0 billion of trading volume, Bit-Z meanwhile holds down second place with $1.25 billion of volume, and OKEx is in third place with approximately $913 million. Binance, meanwhile, is a distant fourth with a trading volume of $602 million, followed by Huobi, Bitfinex, ZB, Bibox, HitBTC, and Upbit in the top 10.\n\nIn the 2-minute exclusive above with Electroneum President and CEO Richard Ells, he describes his vision and a plan with **2 and 5 year goals**. In order to achieve these goals changes needed to be made to the blockchain to accommodate the massive flood of new ETN users that will soon be coming (ETN already is on the heels of 2.0 Million users and is on course to pass this milestone any day now\u2026). It was a must and absolute necessity to introduce the ASICS back into the platform.\n\nBy having a dedicated ASIC mining base (as opposed to miners who can switch at will) provides significantly more security. Blockchain communities should embrace ASIC development on their networks rather than resist it. Many developers in the cryptocurrency world say that the fears of centralization are overblown and that ASICs actually improve the security of a cryptocurrency network by making them harder to dominate with raw computing power.\n\nWith large GPU-based mining operations there is a lot of jumping from coin to coin and mining the most profitable coin.  ETN was abused by them for much too long. For smaller networks in particular, like ETN at the moment, high volatility in hash rate (caused by large scale miners \u201cjumping\u201d between coins) did pose a threat as it could lead to less stability and security, thus increasing vulnerability. This was certainly a factor why Electroneum had to take these actions (and indeed some of the best and most swiftly executed actions I have seen so far). Big exchanges are looking for stable coins with no drama. I am happy to see CoinBene listing ETN, and they will need a stable block chain like the one we now have to sustain the power of a big exchange.\n\nIt was not a matter if, but when, someone would come along with enough rented hash power and raid the network for 51&#37;. Can I tell you, had that happened you would see the same group of people pointing their fingers that the dev team is doing a crappy job and why they did not stop it. Well guess what: ETN has stopped the monster everyone was afraid of. This was a BRILLIANT move and no one had seen it coming -- JOB WELL DONE ETN! Keep it up \u2013 in no time you will become the coin that everyone is forced to reckon with.\n\n**Consider this:** 20 Million ETN users (and quite possibly more). If each only has just 1,000 ETN that is the entire circulating supply. \u2026and there are many, many, many users who hold millions of ETN.  There will come a day when we are talking about ETN in dollars, not cents. Yes, dollars. And now you see why.\n\n[The coin that will change the world](https://preview.redd.it/1r3idlychq811.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eccefbbb2d6bcf85a498c7bb14c2e05ed7e7f094)\n\n**Bonus:**\n\nHere is a little something extra for the entire Electroneum community including those who disagree, gave up or lost faith in this coin/project, it is not too late to get back in the game you know! To all of the die hard fans and supporters out there, youtubers, ETN Telegram Channels KQ, The Army, Knights, ETN Main, ETN Business, ETN Price, Discords and Reddit Channels/Teams. To all the admins keeping the peace on reddit and telegram moderating the content and putting up with a lot of nonsense and assisting the ones who needed their help. To all and any individuals that had contributed in any way what so ever directly or indirectly, if you are sitting on the sidelines and want to get involved **join us** we are looking forward to working with you. Special Thanks to the Electroneum Media and Dev Teams who worked through all the fud,  hate, manipulation and the name calling. Finally, to the ETN Executive Team  Mr. Ells & Mr. Gorman for slaving 100+ hours a week and delivering on their promises.  Thank you all for a Job Well Done or as we like to say: Bravo Zulu (BZ)! The short video below was made just for you. Enjoy!\n\n[Fud Eater](https://reddit.com/link/8x2eim/video/c61vhznwer811/player)\n\n[**Electroneum (ETN): Unstoppable If We Work As A Team.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Electroneum/comments/8srm0y/electroneum_etn_unstoppable_if_we_work_as_a_team/)\n\nTo be continued\u2026",

Having said that i think we owe it to the ETN that we give more time to prove themselves, clearly they had been around for only 8 months.

So aren\u2019t we incentivized to keep the value of 1 lumen to remain low for low transaction fees? \nI\u2019m having a disconnect with how XLM holders are necessary for the ecosystem, apart from using XLM as a transaction fee. Since Stellar Foundation holds the majority of XLM in existence, and when one uses the service the gas fee goes back to the Stellar Foundation, the model seems to flow $$/XLM back to the Stellar Foundation, either through the former or the latter.",

The cryptomarket is all about prospective bettors looking to make fast money.\n\nNow that xrp movement has stabilized, you can expect the impatient people who are just going for quick profits to move on, even if it's at a loss, because they don't want to pay the opportunity cost of holding on to boring old xrps.\n\nSo just hold on. News will eventually come. The price will climb again, and the gamblers will flood in once more, inflating the price. ",

That is, the same 'points' can also be used on the communities own website/forum/discord - and that is really cool! This is a first step in a vision that I personally hold of the future where I believe it is inevitable that digital points/assets/items (eg. game points/currencies, trading cards, cosmetics/flairs, video game items) become tangible AND TRADEABLE items irrelevant of the community presence you choose to be interacting with.\n\nQUESTION: From an OMG Network technical standpoint, how far into that vision could OMG Network on L2 fulfill with its plasma architecture? I know it will excel at currency/token/points but what about digital collectibles and/or video game items?"

We early adopters believed in the tech, and the sub revolved around the tech. We didn't care about profit, but about fundamentally helping the world. **In the choice between 200% profit or ensuring Stellar becomes adopted and changes the world, we would choose the latter.**\n\nBut as Stellar rises, speculators come in. Look at /r/bitcoin, /r/btc, /r/litecoinmarket, and other similar subs to tell you what to expect. This sub will be swamped with memes, hundreds of posts on small price fluctuations, downvote brigading of ANY discussion of the tech because any tech discussion necessarily requires self-criticism of the product. \n\nThis is inevitable. Perhaps we can't avoid the incoming scourge, but we can mitigate it. As early adopters, don't just upvote nice posts. Actively DOWNVOTE posts that treat Stellar as a get-rich-quick-scheme. Downvote stupid memes and stupid price posts. \n\nEdit: My prescription for any mods listening is that we ban all posts related to price or memes. Already the top three posts are about prices. Perhaps make an /r/stellarmarkets, but heavily moderate /r/stellar to be about development. \n \nEdit 2: Now that this post has picked up some steam, I should probably apologize for my aggressive tone. 7 years of active Redditing makes you jaded and prone to pre-emptive aggression lest people start insulting you first.  This is an explanation, not an excuse. But it would be nice if you asked me for clarification instead of just assuming what I meant.

        "post_body": "So, let me get this straight...\n\nIn 2004, Ryan Fugger got this idea of creating a global decentralized monetary system that could allow individuals/communities to create their own money. This led to the creation of RipplePay.com (2005).\n - This was even before the release of the legendary Bitcoin whitepaper by Satoshi Nakamoto, which was in 2008.\n\nFast forwarding to 2011 : Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto and David Schwartz get together, foresees the problems Bitcoin is going to face in the future (i.e. now), and starts developing a digital currency (XRP) which is faster, cheaper and more energy efficient than Bitcoin.\n\n2012 : Chris Larsen joins the team. They approach Ryan Fugger, after long discussions, who handed over the reins. Thus, OpenCoin was founded.\n\n2013 : OpenCoin becomes Ripple Labs.\n\n2014 : Ripple, seeing the massive potential of blockchain technology, proposed Codius. Codius is a project to develop a new\u00a0smart contract\u00a0system. Ripple sort of benched Codius to focus on international remittances.\n- Ethereum was proposed late 2013 and went live in 2015.\n\nRipple's vision of \"not one, but many blockchains\" led to the creation of the Interledger Protocol which lets different blockchains and networks interoperate.\n\n2018 : CODIUS IS BACK!\n Stefan Thomas (inventor of the Interledger Protocol) steps down as CTO of Ripple and launches his project Coil, which aims to allow micropayments for content management. It will be using Interledger Protocol, and carry XRP tokens for monetization.\n\nMy point is :\n\nRipple is building a completely game changing ecosystem. How ?\n\nWell, they took on the top 2 cryptocurrencies....\n\n[- Bitcoin focussed on being a global currency. But XRP can, right now, do everything Bitcoin can wayyy better.\n- Ethereum focussed on smart contracts. Codius is back ! Let's see where that goes.]\n\n....and at the same time, they are on the cusp of ANNIHILATING, oh well, the biggest payment network in the world (SWIFT).\n \n\n\n#RipplesGlobalTakeover",

Sometimes instead of shitting on a project because you holding a bag. Make the community PUMP which in return PUMPS THE BAGS!! Especially in a BULL CYCLE.  THIS IS THE YEAR !

        "post_body": "**UPDATE At 7:04 AM UTC 3/13/18 I received a transfer of the missing BTCP on Trade Satoshi. So far, all of our group members are reporting the same.**\n\nTrade Satoshi announced before the snapshot that all ZCL held on Trade Satoshi would be credited with BTCP.\n\nAnnouncements were made on [their website](https://texascryptocoach.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/TS-main-page-announcements.png), and on [Twitter](https://texascryptocoach.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Twitter-announcement.jpg). This news was retweeted by the official Bitcoin Private team.\n\nLeading up to the fork, users were not given any extra instructions. After the fork was over, many users were shocked to find much less BTCP in their account than they had been holding in ZCL.\n\nMany of us thought it was a mistake, and gave Trade Satoshi many days to make it right. Many of us opened support tickets. And now, Trade Satoshi has explicitly stated that they will not be crediting us the full amount of coins we are owed. Imposing rules after the fact, like saying that an open sell order somehow disqualified the owner of the ZCL from gaining BTCP.\n\nIt appears to be a shameless money grab, and many of us lost a lot of money. In my case, it was nearly half of my life savings.\n\nWe are clearly in the right, and the law is clearly on our side. But this is crypto, and it can be easy for scammers to get away with it.\n\nWe are forming a group to advocate for all those who join it to receive the BTCP they deserve. We will not go quietly. We will be a squeaky wheel and a thorn in their side. This may be small potatoes to Trade Satoshi, but this is huge for us. They cannot get away with this, and we will not let them.\n\nCurrently we are trying to get a feel for how many people are upset about this and willing to act. If Trade Satoshi stole your BTCP, please leave your story below.",

        "post_body": "- At this very moment, RaiBlocks is trading at $29 down from its all time high of around $37. This means you are not even buying the top and are likely seeing the lowest entry point you will ever see again. \n\n- Bit-Z will officially be listing XRB as a tradable crypto tomorrow which coincides with the closure of the Binance poll. The winner of this poll gets listed on Binance within a week. Guess who's dominating the vote with a 2:1 ratio over second place? Yes, RaiBlocks. Bit-Z will open the door for so many investors who were afraid of putting money on the unknown exchanges of BitGrail and Mercatox. I've spoken to many people with big pockets who are waiting for this chance to buy who were unwilling to buy on the currently accepted exchanges.\n\n- Getting listed on Binance. Sure there may be an initial correction, but every coin listed has since surged to 4-5x past original price within a month.\n\n- Rebranding: A rumor which has been all but proven to be true has leaked the rebranding of RaiBlocks. This will point to RaiBlocks being renamed to \"Nano\" a much more adoptable, sleek, relevant name. This will likely be announced next week sometime based on a rough estimate of one of the developers stating that something big was going to be announced.\n\n- Along with the rebranding, the leaked site shows a beautifully redesigned website and a new wallets. Both of which (especially the wallets) always have a fantastic effect on overall price.\n\n- XRB is still not compatible with hardware wallets. This is inevitable and if renamed to Nano, the Ledger Nano S is just a perfect fit to work harmoniously with. There are so many investors out there who refuse to invest in anything they cant keep in cold storage. This will bring in a lot of new money.\n\nNow if you haven't forgotten, XRB is the quickest crypto on the market, has no fees, and allows for unlimited scalability. The team is brilliant and loves interacting with the community, which as a whole is my favorite I've ever been involved with.... and I've been involved in quite a few. \nAt the end of the day, the choice is yours. However, you'd be out of your mind not to think this is AT LEAST a top 5 coin. See you in the next galaxy everyone. ",

        "post_body": "Just thinking aloud here.  \n\n\n\nTo begin with, I am NOT worried about the current XRP value dip.   As I mentioned in my previous [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ripple/comments/8q7w7z/imho_xrp_price_is_totally_irrelevant_until_real/), I think the current XRP value is purely speculative, so I'm NOT worried about that. I'm just waiting for when the current dip reverses, and then I'll buy some more XRP on it's way up.  \n\n\nHaving that said, I AM a bit worried. Because the way I see it, the future is looking very bright for Rapid and XRP. Almost TOO bright. So I MUST be missing something. Because when things look too good to be true, they probably are. So in the back of my head I'm thinking, what am I missing? What could go wrong?  \n\n\nCould Ripple fail catastrophically due to some unforeseen upcoming regulations? Could a potential SEC ruling of XRP being a security void the usage of XRP as a utility token? Something like that? I'm trying to see the grim alternatives here. But it is difficult, as we in the Ripple community are kind of echo chamber positive about XRP. So I'm trying to see beyond that..  \n\n\nSo I was thinking.. maybe we all could put our critical thinking caps on, and try to envision what setbacks could arise ahead, and then, for each of them, discuss the probabilities of them happening, and their consequences. I think it would be sane, to have that kind of constructive criticism discussion.",

This is based on almost $100 million trade volume and 0.25% fee for BOTH buyer and seller.\n\n2) They purposely disabled wallet 2 times in a row in the 48 hours leading up to the fork. They try to blame this on ZCL team and even force ZCL team to bend over backward to push an update for them. If the problem really existed, they could have just spent a fraction of the daily $500k to fix the problem from their end. The wallet problem is merely an excuse because disabling wallet worked greatly to their benefit. This helped increase volume per #1. More important, they benefited greatly from insider information. Sell high, spread fud by disabling wallet then buy low before enabling wallet. Repeated twice. \n\n3) They already made it clear they will not credit BTCP for BTC. From this alone, they are able to claim a shit ton of BTCP. This is not too bad as other exchanges that do not support the fork are in the same position. The scary part is they hold a shit ton of ZCL at the fork, meaning that Bittrex is probably the biggest BTCP holder right now, even if they have to credit these BTCP to users later on. I think they have at least 100k if not 500k coins. BTG was the last major fork. Remember the massive crash to $50 just before Bittrex opened up the BTG/BTC market? And the massive recovery to $300 afterward. My best guess is that Bittrex dumped the shit out of BTG on HitBTC to buy low then immediately 6x the price by their announcement. Would not be surprised if it takes weeks for Bittrex to release BTCP, as they will only do so after they have manipulated and potentially kill BTCP.\n\nTLDR: Expect Bittrex to dump and pump the shit out of BTCP during the next week. Weak hands, do not get manipulated into selling.\n\n",

Then, parent company, formerly Omise, now Synqa, sold OMG Network to Genesis Block Ventures.\n\nMy question is this: What does the OMG in OMG Network even stand for at this point since we're now, like, 3 ugly divorces removed from the original \"Omise\" moniker? \n\nDo token holders now officially bear the shame of holding  \"Oh My God Network Tokens\"? \n\nAre we due another yearly rebrand to GBV Network? \n\nAlso, bonus question--A lot of people on the internet are going on and on about how 2020 was like the \"worst year evaaa\" for some reason, butt I didn't think it was all that bad until now.

        "post_title": "The Ticket Price Algorithm Vote Was Controversial - Fee Analysis",
        "post_body": "An oft-repeated myth I have seen is that changing the ticket price algorithm was not a controversial change.  In this post, I will provide a fee analysis to show why that simply is not true.  I originally posted this in response to another comment, but I thought it warranted its own post, because it is something that seems to be a widespread misunderstanding.\n\nFor some background, prior to the vote to change the ticket price algorithm, the ticket prices swung wildly which encouraged all tickets to be purchased during a single interval when the price was artificially low, followed by discouraging any purchases at all for several intervals due to the price becoming artificially high.  This led to intense fee competition during the single interval where tickets could reasonably be purchased.\n\nThe result, naturally, was that proof-of-work miners were making extremely high fees during those low ticket fee intervals because stakeholders were having to fight to get their tickets in by paying massively inflated fees.  This can easily be seen by looking at the blocks on a block explorer and calculating the fees.  For example, consider blocks [146304](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/block/146304) through [146447](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/block/146447) which was a low interval for the ticket price at 44.46486818 DCR.  The total fees paid to PoW miners during that period was a whopping **787.07299693 DCR**.  Now compare that to the interval after it from [146448](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/block/146448)  through [146591](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/block/146591), which had a ticket price of 124.44844438 DCR, and only paid total fees of **8.49359368 DCR**.\n\nWe can also compare it to after the vote passed and the new algorithm settled in for blocks [154368](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/block/154368) through [154511](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/block/154511).  Despite the ticket price being at a local low of 57.27380227 DCR, the total fees paid was **7.76477816 DCR**.\n\nSo, as demonstrated, the fact is that PoW miners had a **huge** incentive to keep the ticket algorithm the same, yet the vote passed and the hard fork happened regardless.  I ask you to consider how difficult that change would be in a pure PoW coin.  I would argue that making the change was far more controversial than the entire multi-year block size debate in Bitcoin, but even if you don't agree with that assessment, it is difficult to argue that a ~100x cut in miner profits was not a controversial change.",

        "body": "I generally agree with the sentiment in this post but what I will say is that I think contentious and controversial protocol changes are generally more noticeable depending on the size of the community and the amount of money at stake. Had this vote taken place a few years into the future with a community size of 100,000 plus, a price of DCR in the 1000s and a mature ASIC community. The change would appear extremely more controversial. Especially considering that in future there will probably be a fair few ASIC miners that were able to do really well when Decred's ASIC market was still in it's infancy, able to accumulate a significant stake and use their wealth to fund anti-fork propaganda. We may of seen more contention in the voting outcome but still without a doubt a successful vote."

        "post_body": "Anyone from the EOS team. We need to have a nice way to generate our EOS private and public key pairs, during the registration process, on the ledger nano s. This would enable large investors to get in and feel more confident during the registration process. As of right now on the EOS.io distribution page, there is a button for MEW users that generates your EOS keys. I want to use MEW to store my EOS tokens on my ledger nano s, however using an web interface to generate these private keys on eos_io does not seem like the most impressive approach to tackle this problem. We need the BEST practices to make this transition go as smoothly as possible into June when we port over. This extra sense of security will go a long way in terms of trust, and making me want to invest even more. The good news is that we have a great potential solution.\n\nSo please, devs, get on this asap. Let's add ledger nano support now before we get to June! We will all sleep a little better! \n\n**There seems to be confusion as to what this post is referring to. I am talking about generating an EOS key pair for the native EOS blockchain that will go live in June. I am not talking about generating a new Eth address to store your erc20 eos tokens. Please understand this difference, it is crucial to the point that I am trying to make. We need a secure way (using a hardware wallet) to generate the EOS address key pair. That way we are not having to copy and paste our private keys back and forth in a dangerous way. The EOS private keys that are generated should be kept and handled by a device such as the ledger, in an EOS specific app. This is different than the Eth private key that is generated by the Eth ledger application.**",

KR exchanges are implementing changes which will be completed tomorrow.\n- new bank accounts for depositing/withdrawing fiat\n- freezing out all foreigners from depositing any new fiat\n2. All fiat deposits have been blocked since Jan. 20th. So tomorrow the floodgates might very well reopen.\n3. KR might not have the same amount of impact/volume going forward since foreigners no longer have access to put money into the exchanges. However (as is the case with me), foreign accounts can remain active for trading and withdrawals.\n\nICX - watch out as it might be on the verge of a serious run. Their first annual summit just happens to be in 2 days. What better time to be added to some/all of the major KR exchanges (since they are the Korean ETH, backed by the KR government and major businesses and institutions here.) Also rumors of some big announcements during the summit. If you've looked into ICX you'll see it's about as solid as any crypto can be. Not hyped, just built for real world use going forward. \n\nOf course all of you should DYOR on this. Happy trading!",

I'll likely buy back in at some point, probably at a higher price.

I've opened a support ticket, I've emailed support+reddit@coinbase.com, I've PMed the official Coinbase reddit accounts, and I tried Twitter DMs. If anyone from Coinbase is reading this, Case ID: 1653972.\n\nI did an overnight transfer of $200,000 to Coinbase on 5/30. The amount was never credited to my account so I opened a support ticket. They got back to me two weeks after the transfer, on 6/12. It turns out my bank (BoA) did the transfer as an overnight ACH, which Coinbase does not support. The 'specialist' assigned to my ticket told me that my bank needed to recall the ACH transfer.\n\nI immediately called the BoA Commercial Banking team (we all talk shit about the banking system, but at least they have phone lines...) and asked them to recall the ACH. BoA told me that the governing body for ACH transfers prevents recalls if more than 1 week has passed since the transfer. They confirmed that the money was successfully transferred to Coinbase's bank account and gave me a trace ID so that Coinbase would be able to confirm the transfer. I sent the info over to Coinbase support and never heard back.\n\nNow here I am, 4 weeks later, still waiting for Coinbase to get their shit together. I understand that their support team must be swamped with requests right now, but this is ridiculous. What kind of organization 'loses' $200,000 in their bank account and doesn't sort it out within 1 month?\n\nRegarding Coinbase not supporting overnight ACH transfers:\n\n* Is this in Coinbase's documentation anywhere? Nope. \n\n* Do they accept other types of ACH transfers? Yup.\n\n* Is there a good reason to not support overnight transfers? As far as BoA can tell me, no. No there is not.\n\n**Edit:** For everyone wondering why I'm posting on reddit instead of lawyering up, it's because fixing my problem will only take a Coinbase employee 5 minutes. I'm asking reddit for help not because I think reddit will solve the problem for me, but because I hope a Coinbase employee sees this post. I will definitely contact a lawyer if this isn't resolved soon. Thanks for all your support.\n\n**[6/28@3pm PDT] Edit:** Still no response from Coinbase. The support ticket says \"Updated: Jun 28, 2017 08:55AM PDT\" but there is no new message. I think this means someone at Coinbase saw the reddit post and marked the ticket as high priority but didn't bother to respond.\n\n**[6/28@5pm PDT] Edit:** Coinbase has responded to the support ticket. They gave an explanation for their ACH system and said the money has been returned to my account and will \"show up within a few business days\". I will make a final update when the $200,000 shows up in my account.\n\n**[6/30@7am PDT] Edit:** The $200,000 has been returned to my bank account. Thanks for the support and visibility reddit.",

        "subreddit": "Stellar",
        "post_title": "Why I'm confident in XLM's",
        "post_body": "Given this latest dizzying dip in XLM price, I feel the need to explain why I'm not panicking. Before I invested in crypto, I was a big investor in stocks. Once I stumbled on crypto, I pretty much quit stocks and never looked back. You should already be familiar with Stellar\u2019s mission and their excellent technology, so I won\u2019t go there.  Instead, I\u2019m going to summarize why I feel confident about the future value of XLM\u2019s and about Stellar in general, from a stocks perspective.\n\n* 1. The XLM price dips aren\u2019t necessarily reflective of Stellar.\n\nIt should be obvious by now that the price of XLM (and other cryptos) usually moves with the price of Bitcoin. This is similar to how stocks in a certain sector move. For example, stocks in the medical sector usually move together, especially when there is news that can affect all of them (like when Congress passes a law about Medicare reimbursement). Yes, XLM seems to dip more (higher percentage) than Bitcoin in each case, but that\u2019s likely due to XLM\u2019s lower volume and sub-dollar price (similar to how penny stocks move).\n\nIt should also be obvious that some cryptos, especially those that show progress in partnerships and technology, will eventually break free from the Bitcoin influence and trade on their own merits. We\u2019ve already seen how XLM has jumped higher independent of Bitcoin. Yes, the biggest instance of that jump (early January 2018) seemed to be mostly wild exuberance, but there have been other smaller jumps due to real progress. It may take some time, but I believe XLM\u2019s permanent breakaway from Bitcoin will happen.\n\n* 2. You don\u2019t have to wait very long for a movement in price.\n\nIn the world of stocks, it can take a long time for the price of your stock to make a significant move up or down. For example, well-established stocks only make a strong move when quarterly reports (every 3 months) show the company is making lots of money or losing lots of money.\n\nWith XLM\u2019s (and cryptos in general), you can get big price movements fairly often, especially since we are still in the turbulent early phase of the crypto market. Yes, the roller coaster movements (especially the massive dips) can be traumatic for many investors, but to seasoned investors both the dips and the rises are opportunities to gain something. Whether you\u2019re hoping for a drop or a rise in XLM\u2019s (or any other crypto), you don\u2019t have to wait nearly as long for your chance as you would if you owned stocks.\n\nBy the way, I\u2019m a HODLer of XLM\u2019s, but if I somehow can foresee a temporary dip, I WILL sell some of my XLM\u2019s and then re-buy at the lower price. Why not.  \n\n* 3. Stellar\u2019s tokens can be as exciting as XLM\u2019s.\n\nJust as I believe Stellar\u2019s XLM will eventually break free and trade on its own merits, I also believe that some of Stellar\u2019s tokens will also break free and trade (pricewise) on their own merits. You can already see some Stellar tokens, like Smartlands (SLT), make major moves on their own merits. Pretty much all of the tokens are in the infancy stage, so each\u2019s merits will be evident in each\u2019s own timeline.  For me, I have converted some of XLM\u2019s to Stellar-hosted tokens (like SureRemit) seeking gains while also supporting the Stellar network. If for no other reason, it gives me additional hope that some of these companies will make it big.\n\n* 4. Stellar is still in its early stage of development, so the best is yet to come.\n\nI realize that there are many investors who react to every price move or every piece of news (or lack of news), hoping for huge returns as if it\u2019s overdue.  But if you accept that Stellar and most other cryptos with a solid global mission are still in their development phase, then you shouldn\u2019t necessarily expect those huge returns until major milestones are reached. Otherwise, you\u2019re probably trading on sheer hope and hype.\n\nWhen I was investing in stocks, I was looking for the next small company with blockbuster potential. Specifically, I was interested in startup companies that were developing a potential medical drug with huge potential if the drug could show success in clinical trials. Choosing and investing in those companies when they were young (and their stocks were literally pennies) offered a chance to make big money with only a small investment.  Yes, very few of these companies ever realize their potential (most drug candidates fail their clinical trials), but there are some successes for the lucky investors. The key is to get in early and stick with them as long as you reasonably can.\n\nI look at crypto investing, especially Stellar, in the same way as investing in medical startup stocks, but I feel even more confident with Stellar than with any startup medical company. First of all, with potential drug candidates, it is expected that nearly all of them will fail, but it can take years of clinical trials just to prove that a drug doesn\u2019t work, and in the meantime, very little knowledge of progress is visible to the investor (the companies can\u2019t reveal ongoing results of clinical trials, only when the trials are completed). With Stellar, especially it being non-profit, the ongoing progress of the technology, partnerships, and adoption are all transparent and fairly easy to follow and understand. I can more easily gage its progress, likelihood of success, and reasons for price movements, all of which makes me feel more empowered about investing in Stellar.\n\nIn summary, I\u2019m a Stellar investor and believer who understands the risks, has experience with investing in stocks, has done my research (and continues to do so), sees the advantages of crypto investing (especially Stellar).  And based on what I know so far, I am very confident in Stellar and will continue HODLing XLM, even during these rocky times.",

The option of \"English\" in the upper right hand corner of the TRON site has been available for a few weeks now, it is not a new feature. \n\nJustin tweeted: [\"After our SF office opens we will have a better English version of everything soon!\"](https://twitter.com/justinsuntron/status/950212535977848832) \n\nI assume this includes a new website as well. An idea would be to try and reach out to Justin via Twitter to get a confirmation on the status of the website. However, I do think it will take a few weeks for them to hire the proper help in San Fran. \n\n**#2**\n\nThe official TRX site wallet is also a **work in progress**.\nIt is currently **NOT SECURE**, it does not have 2FA. \n\nFrom coinengineer's [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tronix/comments/7o88a5/code_analysis_followup_testing_infrastructure_and/): \n\n>Tron Wallet is being worked on right now! As you can see here -> https://imgur.com/a/G3BRa the development team has another closed source repo where they do their upcoming feature work. Also, note how the main developer is Verified on Github. This is a very good thing from a security point of view.\n\n \n\n**BE CAUTIOUS SENDING LARGE AMOUNTS OF TRX TO YOUR SITE WALLET**\n\nIt is known that the first 1 million wallets registered on the site will receive free TRX, but it was never stated that TRX had to be in the wallet. \n\nThe wallet is still functional, others have used it for buying TRX Dogs with no problems, but this is just a warning. If you do want to test it out, send a small amount of TRX first. \n\n",

        "post_body": "Andy Freer is the former Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of Dash who is now taking the lead on Dash Incubator. Andy's contributions have been instrumental to Dash's technological progress over the years and now he's creating quite a buzz within Dash development via [Dash Incubator](https://dashincubator.app/output), which is a bounty program for incentivizing development on the Dash network. It was a very interesting read which deserves to be posted here before the comments are buried in Discord chats. Andy is usually quite active chatting with other developers at the [Dash Devs Discord](https://chat.dashdevs.org/), so this was an opportunity for the overall community at [Dash Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/PXbUxJB) to get an insight into where he sees Dash going this year and his idea on strategies to drive utility and adoption. In short he is very optimistic of Dash's future, says Dash is working on \"(what I consider to be) the best and most disruptive forthcoming innovation in this space\", and expressed full confidence in the DCG team and their technical capabilities.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have consolidated his recent Discord comments which took place over a few hours, and added context in bold.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Andy was asked to share his opinion on how he anticipates driving growth for the Dash network in 2021.**\n\n  \nI see the key to driving network growth as reaching a broader market of users through making Dash easier to use and providing new use cases outside of the current crypto market which is what Usernames & Dapps enable us to do. The key to achieving that will be driving traction and engagement across 2 new groups on the new features: driving mainstream users to signup to Dash (something which is not possible today in any crypto effectively) and secondly driving developers to create trustless end-user applications monetized with Dash (again not possible in any crypto today) and driving the users to those Dapps. For example, Dash.org landing page should be a signup page to Dash itself and one team focus and are measured on the number of signups we are growing.     \n Secondly we need a dev landing page to onboard new devs (mainly Javascript and Mobile) and furnish Dapp devs with the examples, tools and guidance they need to create great and engaging use cases. For example, payment use cases for retail, subscriptions, social media use cases, games/NFT, ecommerce, kickstarting, video, gaming, any kind of apps that will drive engagement and are monetized via Dash, it all feeds back to increased economic activity on our blockchain, and we need to incentivize both groups, e.g. $10 to legit new signups, and dev funding programs such as Dash Incubator... either way, we need to be growing both groups in tandem and we should be incentivizing people who help achieve that growth. \n\n  \n **A Discord user makes a statement comparing this type of activity to airdrops**.\n\n  \nIt's not an airdrop of tokens in anonymous wallets... we're talking legit unique users signing up to Dash itself.  Thats something we want to grow as much as possible, because those users are the customers for what the Dapp devs are building (and potential customers for our money chain off the back of that). Giving the credits removes the friction for that on-ramp within the onboarding and will increase Dapp traction, that should be the focus. The whole point here is to remove friction to onboarding and using crypto. Giving unique users a leg-up to try Dapps (that are driven by economic tx) is a no-brainer. It gives us engaged users that didn't need to learn about wallets, exchanges and withdrawals as their first step. At the end of the day for this to work (and going back to the whole point Evan started this) there needs to be a seamless / frictionless process between telling your normie friend 'hey try Dash', giving them a URL and them actually using Dash for something useful in the same time they do the same on Twitter, Instagram, Facebook etc. Having a signup on the homepage (or some homepage), onboarding to DashPay and receiving small amount of credits, then trying some of the best Dapps all with a few clicks to that is the key. That is where our funding / mindshare needs to be routing right now, not some of the stupidity going on about marketing and 'high level decision making'. Once we have seemless integration with Dapps into DashPay, this will provide some very compelling use cases that anyone can onboard and use, without needing to understand crypto or jump through ton of hoops.  We'll start from a great position... new use cases, frictionless onboarding, signup and use Dash with named account from any device.  It's hardly something to be negative about.  The value will come from mindshare / funding / incentives put into growing that.  Marketing can play a part, just not an important part, same as it doesn't with any disruptive startups (and anyone who legit has a background in this knows already). \n\n  \n **When asked about Dash's data on Google trends.** \n\n  \nGoogle trends of the search term 'Dash' is meaningless.  Dash (the crypto) is a tiny fraction of the market of Dash products (and no I don't think this is an issue in the long term). Second... Google search for alts isn't the main driver or any kind of significant driver at all. People google for 'bitcoin' - but they learn about other cryptos from social media from people already in the space. Within Crypto... anyone around the last 3 years knows about Dash already. The issue is we haven't delivered any innovation with a differential significant enough to drive adoption within the space (which is what then drives new users) since 2016... and because our segment is already saturated with coins with much higher network effect and social presence, but we're about to change that by offering users new features they're going to enjoy and that our competitors don't and we need to focus on that to grow it. This is a tech space... disruptive tech... the innovation is the marketing.  The space ranks itself via markets and influencers... new users come in based on the social media of those people and word of mouth and based on what's new and interesting and whats go the buzz / viral uptake. You cannot fake that with marketing in this kind of space. Every Dash spent on traditional 'marketing' right now is a Dash that could be spent on (what I consider to be) the best and most disruptive forthcoming innovation in this space, and the kicker is this... yes we can flip Dash back to a leading crypto... but we need to unify around how to do that... as I said we need to:   \n\na) grow signups (a new feature in crypto) and;   \n\nb) grow Dapps for those signups to use directly in browser / mobile and within use cases they already like (social media, video, p2p commerce, e-commerce etc). \n\nAnything else is going to continue sending our ranking in the wrong direction, so please lets all focus and get our game together (and stop trying the same non-innovation strategies that have failed us and get behind the devs who are working real hard to make this happen). We need traction on Dapps...  But the core dapps are actually just helpers for existing transactional use cases. For example DashPay is c2c - if we add in Payment Requests (which I know Quantum Explorer etc are planning) then that covers b2c. We've also been working on retail Dapps at PoS etc. So actually uptake of Dapps doesn't have to depend on the advanced ones like decentralized Twitter.. they can make existing Dash cases lot better, username based and frictionless onboarding, usage, both for end-users and merchants. Underneath that our existing features, which although didn't keep us at the front for the reasons I mention so far, when we fix the last mile of removing end-user friction / seamless onboarding and usage, sure they will be indispensable to actually scale and remove delays for users. What I'm saying is whether you think Dash should be allowing decentralized apps or not, the core use cases are actually very simple and very close to what most people are focused on: growing Dash as an easy to use digital cash with the best usability, speed, security in the space...The original point of Dapps was just removing pain-points in the pre and post payments process. For example the exchange of addresses / tx construction between 2 parties (local or remote) before the tx broadcast, then after confirmation the exception handling of over/under payments, refunds, and meaningful/persistant histories between named parties to make auditing / CRM etc lot easier. What happened was the way this was implemented opened the door for a lot more advanced scenarios... but this is really the core use cases of Dash Dapps... they make transactions easier. Again, rather than counter to our core strategy, surely this is something we should be investing in as much as possible and integrating into all our existing core operations of integrations, biz dev, marketing.\n\n  \n **In response to a comment by a Discord user (shortened):**  \n ***\"I believe Dash can reach to $500 or $1000 in a very short time if right steps are taken, just think about how much this price increase allow us to spend more on innovation and improving the product.\"*** \n\nI mean this is the problem with our decline in rankings, we get this kind of low-end pump and dump talk to dazzle 'investors'.... you should really check out some of the pump and dump groups or start a YT trading channel you might have more luck. Dash is a coin of innovation...  we've deprioritized that for lot of failed strategies. Good news is that innovation is soon to launch and all the great devs who are the ones really doing the work here can come forward and make Dash great again. My work is helping our devs to innovate... thats the real driver here and what the market is valuing as it has/does for any leading decentralized crypto project.  The less we spend on development both protocol and ecosystem, the longer things are gonna take...people should check how many devs are working on our biggest features and compare this to the total budgets here to understand... anyway we'll get there with patience so no problem from me. The core payment dapps for c2c and b2c would improve our existing offerings a lot - be fully username based and very simple to use (no need to construct tx, manage a wallet, exchange addresses, automated payment requests, subscriptions, recurring payments, invoicing etc). But as I've been saying I think due to the current crypto market we can offer more reasons to adopt Dash than simpler payments to non-crypto users... one obvious market right now is decentralized social media, whether thats messaging, video, there's lot of demand for alternative solutions.  But essentially any existing Web 2.0 application that uses fiat for monetization (whether thats paying creators, advertisers, p2p commerce) can be built as a Web 3.0 app monetized with Dash on Platform... so its whatever developers decide to create and my strategy is just to attract and incentivize as much of them as possible, to provide use cases for the new users we want to signup. \n\n  \n You can see some of the use cases community devs have created already on the Incubator: [https://dashincubator.app/output](https://dashincubator.app/output) \n\n  \n Also there's a doc with ideas that weren't started yet here: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NQbRk38I-43FIGcy2FyK4DW\\_Er\\_FknpMB2IQprul-Ec/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NQbRk38I-43FIGcy2FyK4DW_Er_FknpMB2IQprul-Ec/edit?usp=sharing) \n\n  \nAnd more ideas in the first column 'Concepts' on the Trello here: [https://trello.com/b/FPJzDcok/dash-incubator-app](https://trello.com/b/FPJzDcok/dash-incubator-app)   \n    \n**Discord user (shortened):  \"I agree with focusing on development right now but the market does not care. LLMQ's, chain locks, etc. Have limited to no impact on our price. A useful Dapp actually will though.\"**\n\n  \nLLMQ / Chainlocks / DML don't provide anything really new / disruptive for end-users.  Evolution is entirely focused on radically changing the experience for the end-user - crypto is really hard to onboard (understand wallets, addresses, concepts, blockchains) so lets just let them signup with an account they can access from any device with a single password (12 words) that contains everything they need.  Paying people is really hard because you need to exchange 'addresses' which are stupidly long numbers - lets just make that another username you can connect with one-time then you don't have to trust anyone your payment is going to the right place.  You want to buy a burger in a store, the customer doesn't need to mess around typing in addresses and the price, they just connect to the merchant via QR scan and the merchant pings them the invoice they click 'yes' on when it pops up.  Then leading to the Web 3.0 use cases where you don't need to signup to a site with an email, you just scan the QR with your DashPay Wallet, and you're logged in.  When you tweet and it wants you to pay credits, your DashPay wallet just signs that silently in the background for you and you don't.   \n I think largely the crypto market itself values innovation based on disruption i.e. how does new feature X give crypto Y an advantage in gaining future market share like most new tech markets - recently that's been Bitcoin as kinda reserve currency status within backdrop of dollar devaluation / inflation of asset & commodity prices / bond yields and it already innovated enough for that with its positioning / network effect, then you have DeFi which is providing advanced decentralized financial products like lending, derivatives, dexes and Ethereum as the platform underneath it.  For Dash our strategy derived from our new tech is really ease of use - giving all the mainstream users who donperhaps t understand how to get into or use crypto to do that really easily, and bring crypto closer into the apps they already use (through web 3.0 enabling them and using Dash for the underlying monetization where possible). LLMQ / Chainlocks etc are critical to the underlying working of that as is our scalability and instant confirmations... but i've always said I think we need to complete deliver of the ease of use side then market that when its marketable. I don't really want to be spending time getting vocal on issues that don't really concern me and with my obvious undiplomatic / no filter style which I'm fine with (hence how I don't usually come forward on anything).  Obviously I'm passionate about our strategy but I'm confident that our new tech will drive the right strategy and actually from my perspective, both on the tech side and interaction with DCG from top to bottom, I'm super happy / aligned and things actually going better than ever for the goals we've been set.  I just get frustrated when I see diversion from that and things that with my own experience don't add up.. which translates to essentially less funding for developing the innovation I think we need to achieve the right strategy which is DashPay / Platform backed up by our leading backend features, and more being spent on things that don't achieve that. That's all it boils down to. My opinion will always be deliver and grow Evolution through support and funding, drive signups, drive use cases (Dapps) and hold back the rest until that baby is born and happily toddling around the market as I'm sure it will be soon thanks to DCG coming through on that and bunch of really smart community devs.  I'm around here if anyone wants me anyway I'm just gonna keep focusing on development.\n\n  \n**A Discord user suggests that maybe we should be getting more communication from DCG leading up to the launch of major developments.**\n\n  \nI think with DCG you have to give them leeway prior to mainnet, because I don't think community understands the pressure they're under internally and actually how hard they're working behind the scenes (like 16 hr days).  From the outside they can seem kinda aloof and don't care sometimes actually internally its the opposite (time spent talking about mainnet delivery is time taken away from that delivery).. I think once they deliver they'll have more time for community interaction because the hardest part (first mainnet launch of L2 which is a massive deal for them especially) will take off a lot of pressure. For me I'm super happy with their performance these days... we can all measure them by the testnet releases / beta products and clearly they've become a well-oiled machine in terms of development on both L1 / L2 and sure lot of exciting things to come as they launch, mature it, add features.  (obviously they have other areas outside of development which I'm guessing have matured too but I don't follow personally). Plus, actually they do manage to answer basically all the dev community questions and there's a lot of interaction going on there as new devs are working on evonet / dapps etc and that's been really important in fostering the dev community growth this past year. But yah I'd say once they have the main pressure off and Evo is on mainnet it would be healthy to open up a bit. For example was really good to watch [the stream with Quantum yesterday](https://youtu.be/ns4g7TbQSOU), lot of technical info / insight actually some stuff I wasn't aware of, and there's lot more devs like Quantum you don't see from the outside.  I think their official community interaction needs to be kinda managed though, because too much could easily get counter-productive (like volume of questions, different people wanting certain features or change things or justify things and that can get repetitive and especially devs don't work well when distracted). I think structurally it doesn't help too that DCG is kinda entirely opaque from community perspective... thats natural because of how it was constructed based on corporate structure.  We avoided that in the Incubator by starting with full transparency as an experiment which actually is working pretty good, but iIs hard to retrofit that. My own opinion though is we can see that DCG is consistently delivering on the new features since EvoNet launch and the best thing is just support as they complete each step to mainnet which is transparent process in itself and also feature-locked so bothering them with asking them to communicate more right now side or justify their existence is gonna hinder not help what we're all working for.  If people want more communication from DCG Im sure that's gonna be more likely after mainnet than before fingers crossed anyway. I know Ryan works flat out and when he has time he's represents us with media, interviews or whatever is needed. Bob has my old job and I can confirm thats not an easy one or one where you have lot of free time to say the least.  Im guessing Bob would have more time after mainnet but you'd have to ask him.  Dana joined after I left, it would be great if he had more time to interact with the community but again i'm guessing his day is filled up with helping the devs launch.  You can say they need to improve on community interaction but you can't say they're not super busy / working flat out thats for sure. \n\n  \n I think there's lots of things that could be improved structurally and with transparency / decision making /scope etc and communications obviously. But the work ethic and dedication going on in DCG is super strong and from technical perspective so is the organization / knowledge / experience they've accumulated, really we couldn't really ask for smarter bunch of people building / delivering Dash at this point.  If that's not apparent from the outside right now, once they deliver mainnet and as they work with the dev community to grow the ecosystem and add features on Platform I'm sure it will be.",

Haveno is a fork of the [Bisq exchange](https://bisq.network/), a decentralized exchange used to trade Bitcoin for national currencies and other cryptos. Haveno is based on Monero, making it **more private** and **cheaper** than Bisq (more info in the [README of the repository](https://github.com/haveno-dex/haveno).\n\nHaveno uses peer-to-peer networking and multi-signature escrow to facilitate trading without a trusted third party custodian. Disputes can be resolved using non-custodial arbitration.\n\nThe project has a core team, at the moment composed of myself (ErCiccione) and Woodser, the lead developer.\n\n## What's the status of the project\nThe platform has a long road to go before being available for public use. As said, the PoC is ready, but everything else needs to be done. We are tracking development using GitHub's issues and projects. Please take a look at  the ['Status of the project' section of the README](https://github.com/haveno-dex/haveno#status-of-the-project), but basically the most important tasks we are working on are:\n\n- **We need a logo**. Right now it's a random stock image ([#1](https://github.com/haveno-dex/haveno-meta/issues/1))\n- **The User Interface is basically still Bisq**. Needs to be completely reworked and adapted for Monero as base currency (https://github.com/haveno-dex/haveno/projects/2). We are already in contact with an interested designer, but nothing has been decided yet.\n- **Clean-up the repository** from Bisq-specific content (https://github.com/haveno-dex/haveno/projects/1)\n\n## How can the community help?\nNow we badly need:\n\n- Contributors\n- Funds\n\nIf you can help in any way, please let us know. Right now we mostly need coders (Java), network experts (for the underlying P2P/Tor infrastructure) and designers, but any help in any field would be really appreciated. Just contact us and let's build Haveno together!\n\n**Funds are also fundamental at this stage**. If you can, please [sponsor](https://github.com/haveno-dex/haveno#sponsors) or [donate](https://github.com/haveno-dex/haveno#support) to the project. We are thinking of incentive development through bounties, but we will also need funds to continue development. We are also considering opening a CCS proposal, but that will be decided later on, also depending by how much funds we are going to get without CCS.\n\n## Where are we?\nThe [haveno-dex GitHub organization](https://github.com/haveno-dex) is our base. The main repository where the code sleeps is [haveno](https://github.com/haveno-dex/haveno), but we also have a [haveno-meta](https://github.com/haveno-dex/haveno-meta) repository, used for proposals and project-wide issues/features that need to be added/discussed.\n\nWe have two rooms on Matrix, where we discuss and coordinate:\n\n- **Haveno** (`#haveno:haveno.network` - [invite link](https://matrix.to/#/!IEFpSeJArnlszBCPzh:haveno.network?via=haveno.network): For general discussions about the project (relayed on Freenode: `#haveno`)\n- **Haveno Dev** (`#haveno-dev:haveno.network` - [Invite link](https://matrix.to/#/!HeVhOlajgOuVMOKhvS:haveno.network?via=haveno.network&via=monero.social&via=matrix.org)): For development related coordination and support (relayed on Freenode: `#haveno-dev`)\n\n## The question everybody want to ask\nYes, Woodser is already working in implementing atomic swaps for XMR <-> BTC trades on Haveno :)\n\nWe are very excited to finally go public and we are looking forward to hear your thoughts! :)",

I got frustrated with their lack of response for a long time and sent a message to binance on Twitter saying that they are not responding to my ticket and still did not get a response.

I was sure a fool and believed that they are truly from trust wallet and I did whatever they asked me to do in hopes to recover back my incorrect BNB transaction. I gave them access to my wallet like an idiot by sharing the secret key that they asked me to do and they swiped my wallet clean and left zero balance.

Which of the coins mentioned above is most likely to succeed? I know who I would put my money on (in fact I have).\n\nThe main issue we have at the moment is that XRP is heavily tied to BTC and until we break away as a stand alone currency we will sadly have to endure this sort of volatility. That said we are definitely heading in the right direction for example the SBI announcement earlier in the week which I am pretty certain is the first of many. \n\nYes it is sad to see your portfolio shrink especially if you are not a day trader.

        "post_body": "Happy Holidays everyone!\n\nI hope, like us, you\u2019re looking forward to the New Year!\n\nAs we fast approach the end of 2017, I have a few things to reflect on and share\u2026 so I apologise for the slightly lengthy message, but I hope you\u2019ll welcome the info.\n\nFirst off, I want to say a big thank you for the patience and understanding that has been shown across our ETN community. You\u2019ve handled the teething problems during launch and the delayed release of the wallets with impressive rationale, supporting us with patience and shared commitment to quality and security as we\u2019ve tackled each hurdle head-on. We are incredibly grateful and very encouraged.\n\nTECH UPDATE\n\nLocked Accounts\nWe understand the concerns some of you are experiencing regarding the anomaly that is causing some accounts to lock. We\u2019re working hard to resolve this over the holidays, and we're unlocking as fast as we possibly can. Thanks to everyone who's taken the time to get their ID to us \u2013 rest assured we\u2019re on it, we\u2019ve unlocked hundreds of accounts.\n\nTransaction Issues\nSome of the outstanding transactional issues should be fixed following an update from yesterday and one from this morning, and we'll be writing some new software to fully analyse the issues. We\u2019ll let you know our findings as soon as we know ourselves.\n\nFor now, one particular issue that may be lingering is some incorrect transaction statuses.\nIn short, any transaction that has not changed your balance for more than 24 hours is, essentially, considered \"stuck\". Our recommendation is to check your balance \u2013 if it has remained the same, then you should try the transaction again. Please remember to check first, take a look at your balance, or the wallet you sent it to (if you have access to it \u2013 i.e. an exchange), before attempting to process the transaction again. This problem has affected a number of users but it\u2019s only about one-third of a percent of overall transactions that have been problematic. We are using the data the improve the system, and apologise for the inconvenience. No coins have been lost. If a transaction fails your coins will still be in your wallet, even if it says \u201cpending\u201d.\n\nWhilst we have had some hiccups and issues, I hope you agree that we have made history within a very short space of time with what we have achieved, from the ICO through to successfully processing over 300,000 transactions. We designed the system with large scaling in mind, thinking that we\u2019d be building up to a million or more users in a year \u2013 but now we have seen the market interest we realise just how mind-boggling the scale that is required IS! We have routes to market that expose us to over 100m users!!! We have the results of some brand new feasibility studies that have taken place over Christmas and are ready to start coding some even larger scaled systems in the New Year and will be recruiting specialists where required. Now we truly stand to establish a worldwide, recognised brand.\n\nRemember, we haven\u2019t been around for very long \u2013 it\u2019s only a matter of weeks, with the ICO closing early November and the wallets only released mid-December!\n\nThe decision to delay the release of wallets weighed heavily on us all; it was an incredibly difficult move, but ultimately security was our top concern and our team worked tirelessly with HackerOne to ensure we could move forward with a system that is as secure as we could possibly be. Sometimes we have to make tough decisions, but we will always make the best decision for the brand and the business.\n\nOn that note, our team here at ETN HQ have given their full focus on developing and launching our product, and they have dealt with all the challenges that have been thrown at us with a firm hand and confident direction \u2013 all the while making our product more resilient and more valuable with every challenge that we overcome.\n\nIn terms of mobile access to the blockchain, we\u2019re operating on a transactional scale that has never been achieved in this way before; we\u2019re combining a de-centralised blockchain with a centralised mobile app, which is breaking new ground, taking cryptocurrency in a direction that no one thought possible.\n\nIf it was easy everyone would do it. They\u2019re not. We are?\n\nA few stats\u2026\n\nYou might like to hear some stats on what we\u2019ve actually achieved in the period up to Christmas:\n\u2022 over 300,000 completed Blockchain transactions involving over 2 billion ETN on our system.\n\u2022 Over $290m USD of ETN has been traded on Cryptopia and the ETN price has remained around $0.08 USD \n\u2022 Over 350,000 SMS messages have been delivered\n\u2022 Over 50,000 new Elecrtoneum accounts have been opened since we launched the wallets.\n\nI\u2019m really proud of all these figures and look forward to seeing them grow significantly.\n\nOf course, we will likely encounter more challenges as we progress, but the good news is that we will be constantly updating our code in the New Year to help anticipate, combat, and improve the experience further. I feel confident that you\u2019ll continue to be patient, knowing that the reason Electroneum has been so popular is because we are doing something different. It would be great to think we already have all the answers - but we don't \u2013 we\u2019re evolving, and we\u2019re doing it with you helping us make it all happen.\n\nTEAM NEWS\n\nResources have been another issue that you\u2019ve raised with us and so, looking forward, we recognise the need to expand the team, and, our recruitment drive is in full flow, as we look to appoint the right people to help us grow asap. As you know, space has been a challenge for us too, so we have secured new offices to cope with the growing team. We\u2019ll let you know who\u2019s made the grade asap, and we look forward to being able to develop the product faster, and getting the support queue down!\n\nFinally, I want to welcome our newly appointed non-executive director, Chris Gorman OBE. I\u2019ve asked Chris to explain more about why we\u2019ve joined forces below, but I see him bringing tremendous experience from the mobile world, entrepreneurial vision and flexibility, and tech insights from his extensive, first-hand mobile app knowledge. Chris was awarded an OBE for services to business in 2005. He\u2019s been there, got the t-shirt and is still driven to feed his thirst for knowledge, all of which he\u2019s happy to share with us and with you. Chris is helping us with many things that will help our next stage, commercialisation and international growth.\n\nIn closing, I want to reiterate my absolute gratitude for your support, patience, and belief in this great opportunity. I feel very hopeful that 2018 will bring great success for us all and look forward to sharing many good news updates over the coming weeks and months.\n\nMy very best to you and yours here\u2019s to a great 2018!!\n\nRichard\n\nRichard Ells\nFounder of Electroneum.\n\nNow over to Chris\u2026\n\nHi everyone, thanks to Richard for the kind intro, I\u2019m really happy to be in touch with you all and looking forward to great things being achieved together.\n\nAs for me, as well as 30 years in mobile, I\u2019ve worked across a variety of industries with many complex structures and deep experience across tech, retail, e-commerce and mobile app development. I\u2019ve been through very many highs and lows over the years, having navigated many a rocky road with new, innovative and disruptive business models \u2013 so Electroneum is right up my street!!\n\nI became interested in Electroneum because of the specific mobile focus. I could see that this was a real alternative to the existing complicated and elitist structures of the cryptocurrency markets. Offering a mobile digital currency solution, delivered like no other, launched into a very tough, competitive market, ticked a lot of boxes for me and I could see so much potential for the business \u2013 and the product \u2013 and recognised that my experience could segue perfectly into their next stage commercial development.\n\nThe fact that ETN truly delivers for anyone, anywhere, who wants instant access to their own digital wallets, with an easy route to transact and to earn using just a mobile phone, is music to my ears!!\n\nEven more, echoing my long-held and firmly favoured strategy, when I learned that Richard had created a business model that encapsulates a win-win ecosystem to deliver for all stakeholders \u2013 I was buzzed!!\n\nLike many others, I feel very encouraged by the fact that the intense work invested by Richard and the ETN team has led to the creation of some truly innovative solutions for meaningful change and improvement, where users will benefit greatly and investors - who have supported and believed in the concept - will have the added benefit of maximised growth and profit.\n\nIn line with ETN\u2019s strategy, the fastest route to market is mobile; which, as you may have gathered, is where I come in. I am here to help the team wherever I can, and I\u2019m here to help you too as we all move forward.\n\nHaving worked very closely for a long time with mobile operators, I\u2019m very well aware of how much they recognise and want to harness the massive potential that digital currency presents for them and their customers, but they have struggled to find a workable solution to deliver an easy way to transact for the mass market - the economic and user barriers have been way too high.\n\nElectroneum has changed all that, and I can help operators understand exactly how this cryptocurrency app really fits the mobile market, and how our unique commercial model removes the barriers and risks that they would usually face.\n\nWe have signed several commercial MoUs already, and we have some tremendous deals in the pipeline. We have also enlisted some influential PR support to help drive demand and customer acquisition; so I am confident that we have found a formidable solution that makes digital money very real for everyone.\n\nWatch this space\u2026 the first of many partnerships with mobile operators go live within a few weeks, and we have very positive signs that there will be many more to come.\n\nNow over to you\u2026\n\nYour support has clearly been incredible and I want to make sure we can maximise your experience with ETN.\n\nFirst off, I\u2019ll be helping with our comms strategy. Knowledge is power and with accurate info under your wing, you will be able to help us build our business together even more. You\u2019re already helping in many ways with your support for our development, voting for exchanges and so on. I am keen to listen to your opinions and hope that we can empower you further and help to shape the business as we work towards common goals. Together we\u2019re stronger.\n\nTo help boost your points of reference, we\u2019ll be stepping up our comms, aiming for a twice-weekly update.\n\nI recognise how much talent and expertise we have in the community, and I hope we can find a way for you to help develop things like our company Wiki, social reach, more targeted support for exchange applications and other aspects of development that we\u2019ll share going forward.\n\nIn recognition of the value you can add, we\u2019re planning to use the coin we\u2019d allocated for January\u2019s mobile mining, to fund rewards for the help you give, and also to initiate a new referral rewards scheme that you, and everyone you refer, can benefit from until mobile mining launches. More details will follow very soon on this, but the underlying ethic is that none of us gain if we don\u2019t make this work. Working together is the ultimate objective of this business, and reward is always given the highest regard.\n\nLet\u2019s work together on spreading the word further, keeping the messaging positive and staying strong in our belief of what we can achieve. Let\u2019s give Richard and the team a little space to get the last few pieces of our prize formula firmly into place\u2026 we know already that a little space always delivers a meaningful step up in our game!!\n\nOnwards and upwards, we\u2019ll be in touch again very soon.\n\nThanks for everything you\u2019ve done for us, and with us, so far.\n\nI echo Richards best wishes for the New Year and look forward to sharing many great achievements with you.\n\nBest\nChris\n\nDr Chris Gorman OBE\nDirector",

        "post_body": "Hi,\n\nThis is a public call for all projects that have been benefiting from NEO ecosystem to give back. We all have seen that the network needs more well maintained endpoints and protocol level focus. Let's build the infrastructure of the future together. This is a public call for two things:\n\n\n1 - Launch at least 3 or 4 nodes with RPC endpoints and submit a PR to https://github.com/CityOfZion/neo-mon to add the IPs. CoZ has been maintaining the network most accessible endpoints and those have not been sufficient for people running ICOs with dozens of thousands of users, the nodes are provide free and we never asked anything - but you should not take it for granted. Each node can launched in a instance with a configuration similar to **t2.large, that in reserved mode costs $50/mo, that means with $200 monthly you could improve your multi million dollar project**. Please be smart and use multiple regions across the globe to launch your nodes, having 90% of the nodes in one place does no good. Where ? Don't you do analytics on your website ?\n\n\n\n2 - **Sponsor at least one full time developer to improve NEO core, that costs $10k/mo** this can be done inside your own organization or by approaching CoZ and simply saying something like \"Hey, we are building this amazing new thing and are using this project here - we would like to sponsor the maintainer\". Why would you **try** to build a project in weak basis ? This is not about dApp development, is about NEO performance now and in the future.\n\n\n\nThis is a call for stakeholders in:\n\n * Red Pulse\n * Aphelion\n * TheKey\n * Trinity\n * DeepBrain Chain\n * AlphaCat\n * QLink\n * Bridge Protocol\n * NEX\n * Zeepin\n * Narrative\n * Moonlight\n * Switcheo\n * Thor\n * Ontology\n * Loopring\n\n... and all other projects launching and depending on the well behaving of NEO network that those have profited from using the ecosystem.\n\nFor non technical users: this are seed nodes that provide public RPC endpoints, nothing related to consensus or security of the network.\n\nThanks,\nRegards.",

Once they offer USD pairings it is over for Coinbase unless they do exactly what they are doing by adding more cryptos. It just spits in the face of their customers by saying they  are doing it for them. Their customers have been asking for new assets for a while now. They are just doing it to survive. "

        "post_body": "E-mail update from Richard - the team have been busy :)\n\nElectroneum - Tech Update, Instant Payment Patent & More\nHi Everyone, \n\nI\u2019m currently whizzing around Asia and the Middle East to meet with some important contacts that were made at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona.\n\nThis is going to be quite a long update (I\u2019ve just read through it as I make this comment \u2013 and it\u2019s a monster! I knew I should have written a novel) Here\u2019s a synopsis (not in any order) for a fast update \u2013 then read the detail below, if you want to know more\u2026\n\nPatent Pending Secured!\nWe\u2019ve worked on this since last year, it protects our cryptocurrency hybrid system that will allow us to provide INSTANT cryptocurrency payments as well as cryptocurrency subscription payments! It is a game changer for the entire cryptocurrency industry, when it comes to everyday use.\n\nMarket sentiment (and how to change it) \nI\u2019ll cover why the market has been filled with FALSE negativity and how we are going to change it (you can help too!).\n\nTech update (51% Attack, ASICS & more)\nThere is no hard evidence that there IS a 51% attack taking place. The evidence that is being used is not evidence of a 51% attack in this instance, it\u2019s a timestamp bug that is causing no problems at all. ASICS are nothing to worry about \u2013 we have ASIC resistance in the next update \u2013 which will be before the ASIC chips are widely available. Blockchain flooding, we are working on this from two ends \u2013 a blockchain update AND our patent makes the blockchain flooding far less problematic. \n\nNew technical team member introductions\nTwo new blockchain based team members to introduce, who are already well in to fixing everything the market is worried about.\n\nGrowth (let\u2019s end on a positive note!)\nDid you know that Electroneum is ahead of Twitter, Facebook & Dropbox in speed of growth? I\u2019ll explain why.\n\nHere are the full details if you want to dive in. Otherwise, thanks for reading this far - have a great day!\n\nChanging the market sentiment\u2026\nThere is an enormous amount of negative and often false information flying around the internet about Electroneum. There has been a concerted effort by a number of very credible sounding people to try and damage the Electroneum brand for their own reasons or for their own financial gain. \n\nA relatively small number of people have been spreading lies, fears and doubts at any sign of positivity. There is also an automated trading strategy that has kept placing tiny sell orders just under the market price which along with the negative narrative, has resulted in loop of negativity that seems to feed itself.\n\nI\u2019d like everyone to know that the Electroneum project is not in any danger and whilst there are some legitimate questions such as when we will be implementing ASIC resistance (covered below), there is nothing that is going to cause us long term harm. \n\nAn important thing to remember is that a group of people think it is worth spending a lot of their own money, and time, trying to discredit Electroneum and our team. We\u2019ve always expected this because we are disruptive to the industry.\n\nThere is no other cryptocurrency that is poised to reach so many users, and there is no other cryptocurrency that has solved the problem of instantaneous transactions that will allow cryptocurrencies (not jut ours!) to be spent online or in shops, restaurants, caf\u00e9s etc. Currently the volume of ETN traded every day is low and the ability for someone to manipulate the price exists. As we move forwards onto the largest crypto exchanges and we start delivering on our promises, I hope to see that daily trading volumes grow to the point that that cannot be manipulated.  We will change the sentiment of people who doubt the project of the coming weeks and months with both innovative technology and by becoming the first cryptocurrency to start being used in everyday transactions by millions of users.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to see market sentiment changing \u2013 don\u2019t forget you can help! Any time you see negativity for negativity\u2019s sake make a comment that points out some positives. I\u2019m not asking for a giant spam army to take over the world (evil laugh) but all of YOU are Electroneum. It wouldn\u2019t exist without you, so feel free to get involved and make positive comments about YOUR project. Electroneum.\n\nTwo New Blockchain Developers to Introduce\n\nChris Harrison, working from our UK office. Chris joined us recently and has a background in Fintech and blockchain. He brings an exceptionally high level of understanding of the mathematics behind cryptocurrencies and develops in C++ (among others!), the language that our blockchain codebase is written in. He is working closely with our existing team and our second new blockchain starter Andre.\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/christopher-harrison-3a95a2a0/\n\nAndre Patta, working from Brazil. Andre has a huge amount of experience as a corporate software engineer working with companies such as Ericsson, and has spent much of his time in recent years working on the interaction of decentralised technology with the financial sector. He has worked extensively with the blockchain technologies of Ethereum and Monero. \nhttps://br.linkedin.com/in/andre-patta-77859b56\n\nWe are very lucky to have an AWESOME Electroneum team and both of the two new developers will add their strengths and take us to new heights.\n\nTech Update\nBoth of the new team members are already working closely with our existing team to get a blockchain update ready for release. This will include ASIC resistance, update to the core blockchain code, an algorithm tweak to prevent empty blocks being profitable for miners and a number of bug fixes and tweaks.\n\nASIC Resistance \nThere seems to be a lot of misinformation circulating about ASICS. ASICS are a type of computer chip designed to do just one job, and do it well. There is a new ASIC out that enables owners of those machines to mine ETN at a much higher hashrate than GPU miners, however there are currently only very limited numbers of them, and they are not available to purchase at the moment (they are not easy to buy, we are trying to get some for testing). The next batch are due out in June. We will have our ASIC resistance in place before they become a potential problem to us.\n\n51% attack.\nThere are rumours that a 51% attack on ETN is happening. People have been quoting altered timestamps as evidence of this, but that is a bug that we are aware of and has been there since the first day we launched. It will be fixed but is nothing to worry about. Orphaned blocks have no fundamentally negative effect on the functionality of the blockchain.\n\nAny cryptocurrency can suffer from a 51% attack \u2013 where someone controls 51% or more of the mining power, it gives them the ability to make false entries into the ledger \u2013 however there is no HARD evidence that this is taking place. Our investigations have been unable to identify an attack, however people are starting to believe it because of the credibility of some of the article writers and the timestamp issue. Ask yourself this \u2013 if someone could manipulate a cryptocurrency and make money from that manipulation, why would they announce their ability by altering time stamps? They would not. The rumours of this attack are what is called FUD in this market (the spreading of Fear Uncertainty and Doubt).\n\nBlockchain flooding.\nIt\u2019s true that someone is spending their own money to flood the ETN blockchain with transactions. Whilst a lot is being made of it by the same people, It\u2019s actually been quite useful to us, as we need to understand the load requirements for true mass adoption. We have some great data from is and are working on a tweak to the blockchain code that will enable us to do something about this, including a change to the dynamic block sizing algorithm (more on this in another update) \u2013 but remember that our instant payment system that is coming and is protected in our patent (see below), makes a blockchain flooding attack completely harmless against ETN. Our systems can verify the payment and if it takes hours to hit the blockchain, the user and vendor are unconcerned (read about this in the patent section below).\n\nIn short, don\u2019t worry, all the tech is in hand. Technical glitches and problems will always happen in any company scaling as fast as we are \u2013 but we will always find them and resolve them.\n\nInstant cryptocurrency payments & crypto subscriptions - Patent Pending\nWe are completely confident we will be the largest cryptocurrency by user numbers within a year.\nWe are also confident that we will be the most widely USED cryptocurrency, with developments in instant EPOS (electronic point of sale \u2013 or tills as we call them in England!) and ecommerce.\n\nOur instant cryptocurrency payment technology patent is now officially \u201cpatent pending\u201d so we can now discuss some exciting details about it.\n\nI\u2019ve made hints about this for weeks, I really thought we\u2019d have it submitted sooner, but it\u2019s an exceptionally detailed patent that enables us to do some VERY exciting things!\n\nInstantaneous Cryptocurrency Payments\nWe have a hybrid model, with a centralised app and decentralised blockchain it enables us to INSTANTLY confirm to a vendor (shop or online store) that an Electroneum user HAS the funds available in their wallet and therefore they can checkout of an ecommerce system or pay at a shop till and take the goods or service, instantly. We then (internally) ring-fence the funds to prevent them double spending (just like the blockchain does) \u2013 and move the transaction to the blockchain in good time.\n\nThe vendor and the user are happy because they got to buy something in a shop or online with zero fuss, bother or delay, and the vendor trusts us to ensure the payment is on its way. Vendors are used to waiting after an instant SUCCESS or FAILURE message \u2013 as that\u2019s what a credit card machine does. The money from a credit card sale is only deposited into the vendors bank after a couple of days or more.\n\nSome of the retailers we\u2019ve been speaking to right back from last year, absolutely needed instantaneous payments before they would ever consider accepting cryptocurrency \u2013 which is why we\u2019ve spent so much time and effort on this patent and the back-end technology that allows it. (not a small amount of money either!). A lot of large vendors have been waiting for this patent to be filed, as it changes the entire way a cryptocurrency can be used and takes it out from being just a relatively small technical user group, to being a genuinely useful way to make real world transactions.\n\nIf the user is using the Electroneum App or web wallet system, and the vendor has an account with us, the instant payment system will be available to them. Instant payments can even happen between our users \u2013 allowing anyone to instantly transfer funds.\n\nThe back \u2013 end system is not quite ready to roll out, but we\u2019ve already been writing the code in advance of the patent going live. We will have it to MVP (minimum viable proposition) within the next couple of months (sooner if we can), which will allow vendors to get an instant notification of a payment, which they can hook in to their existing payment processing facility. We are working with integration with a couple of mobile network operators first, as we are commercially further ahead with them than anyone else. We are keen to work with any large brands as they can leverage being \u201cfirst in their industry\u201d to accept cryptocurrency and gain the benefit of free publicity.\n\nCryptocurrency Subscription Payments\nSo, if instant cryptocurrency payments wasn\u2019t exciting enough, the technology and the patent covers something else that is a first in cryptocurrencies too, subscription payments in crypto!\n\nOur hybrid model ALSO allows us to prompt a user for permission and then set up a subscription to make a regular payment to a vendor! Who do we know who likes subscriptions? Well, just about everybody in business is the answer \u2013 starting with the mobile operators.\n\nOur patent covers subscriptions in cryptocurrencies and it covers subscriptions in cryptocurrencies to the value of any fiat currency, allowing a subscription to be either XX ETN per month (or week etc) or YY US Dollars worth of ETN per month. Users can control their subscriptions and permissions via a web interface (to be released).\n\nOur patent covers all cryptocurrencies and even allows us to provide instant payments or subscriptions in any OTHER cryptocurrency via our system. The patent is over 100 pages of text and flowcharts, so it\u2019s extremely robust and covers a number of other cryptocurrency innovations too, but I think that\u2019s enough for now!\n\nThat\u2019s right \u2013 we now have a protected patent that allows us to add bitcoin, Ethereum, monero or virtually any other cryptocurrency to our app and allow users to make instant crypto payments to any vendor who wants to have the convenience of instant check-out. This won\u2019t be happening this year, as we want to get Electroneum (ETN) out there first into the market, but it gives us the ABILITY to provide this if the market demands it. We could therefore work with a large multinational vendor who had chosen a different cryptocurrency, but still leverage the Electroneum brand, as part of our strategy for brand dominance and growth.\n\nThere\u2019s bound to be a ton of questions and there\u2019s bound to be a lot of people trying to claim that this can\u2019t happen or it doesn\u2019t exist \u2013 but I assure you that the patent is filed (patent app. Number 1805708.3) and Dentons are confident of our claims, and we are going to deliver everything we\u2019ve said we will. This single jurisdiction patent application protects the idea we apply for global patents. \n\nIt covers a number of other things too, that we\u2019ve discovered by being the first people to ever handle this volume of cryptocurrency users in a hybrid app. Since we\u2019ve found solutions for a lot of the problems, we\u2019ve patented the techniques to give Electroneum the intellectual property rights, enabling us to protect the process, or even earn royalties from their use elsewhere.\n\nOne of the phrases we heard last year speaking to one of the large vendors we are in discussion with was \u201cWhere is your moat?\u201d. What they meant by this is what is to stop someone else coming along and offering the same thing. What protects the Electroneum business model (other than our massive first mover advantage)? This patent is exactly what they were after. If gives them a reason to publicly endorse us as a fintech partner, because we are following the corporate path.\n\nWe are now protected. No new ICO can think \u201cgreat idea\u201d and take it, as it\u2019s protected by global patent laws. \n\nFaster growth than Twitter & Facebook - a positive thought to finish on.\nIn amongst some of the negativity recently I thought \u2013 \u201chey! There\u2019s another thing I\u2019d like to point out to detractors and those with only negative comments for ETN\u201d. We are already up there with some of the greats. Think about it, we\u2019ve already shown that we can grow faster than Twitter, Facebook and Dropbox (we hit 1m users after 5 months of being live \u2013 Twitter took 2 years, Facebook 10 months and Dropbox 7 months).\n\nNow think what we can do with a global patent that enables us to transact any cryptocurrency instantly into any shop or ecommerce system, coupled with a method to introduce new users to cryptocurrency in their millions.\n\nI hope you are as excited about the future as I am. \n\nDon\u2019t worry about the future of Electroneum, we are building strong foundations to ensure we deliver what we\u2019ve always promised. Cryptocurrency mass adoption. It\u2019s coming\u2026\n\nAs always, I wish you all health, happiness and a wonderful weekend\n\nRichard Ells\nElectroneum Founder",

        "post_body": "The bitcoin cash difficulty adjustment algorithm is designed to maintain an average of 6 blocks per hour (one block every ten minutes) across a \"full day\". The fluctuation per hour is normal, sometimes miners get lucky in finding blocks sooner than ten minutes while sometimes it takes longer to find the next block. This is an inherent characteristic of the POW (mining) algorithm used in both Bitcoin Segwit and Bitcoin Cash. As both chains are competing for miner's hash-power to secure themselves, miners constantly migrate from one chain to the other based on the profitability rate (https://fork.lol/). This behaviour is completely normal and it's by design, miners will behave selfishly (as players in a free market do all over the free world) to maximise their profit, this is indeed the main idea behind securing the blockchain, by incentivizing miners to trade their resources for profit in order to secure the network. Bitcoin Cash's new difficulty adjustment algorithm is designed to prevent wild swings in number of blocks found every day. The intent is to keep a consistent rate of 144 block per day which translates into 6 blocks per hour or alternatively one block per 10 minutes. Maintaining a consistent 6 blocks per hour is practically impossible because of the the two main factors mentioned above: the nature of POW algorithm and miners migration from one chain to the other for more profit. That said, keeping the rate consistent over a longer period of time (1 day in Bitcoin Cash case and 14 day in Bitcoin Segwit case) is definitely achievable as we have seen it in such a short time after Bitcoin Cash updated its algorithm. Note that Bitcoin cash is currently able to adjust the difficulty much quicker than one day but due to stability measures taken in the algorithm the focus is to keep the rate consistent for each day, at a roughly 6 blocks per hour rate (https://fork.lol/blocks/time). The Bitcoin Cash algorithm has two modules, Slow-target (over 2016 blocks) and Fast-target (over 13 blocks). The benefits of slow-target hasn't fully materialized yet due to the small number of blocks mined since the upgrade. Some of the blocks mined before the upgrade introduce noisy data points into the algorithm, this problem will be resolved as the time-window slides forward and more blocks are mined. When 2016 blocks are mined (since the upgrade), the combination of slow-target and fast-target should keep the number of blocks mined per hour fairly consistent at 6 blocks per hour. Interestingly enough Bitcoin Cash is maintaining a 20-35% of the hash-rate compare to Bitcoin Segwit. The distribution of the hash-rate is getting more stabilized, which is a good sign for both chains. With this level of stabilization, market will have a easier job to determine the value of each coin.\n\nP.S: I posted this in r/bitcoin, and it was removed in less than 10 minutes!

        "post_body": "**If you have not done so, you will need to create a new pair of EOS public and private keys and register them with an Ethereum address. This only needs to be done once.**\n\nOn or around June 1, 2018 **all EOS Tokens will become frozen and non-transferable** on the Ethereum blockchain. Not long after, I suspect that EOS community members will create a snapshot of token balances that carry over onto a new community generated and selected EOS blockchain. block.one will not be launching EOS blockchains or operating any of their nodes. Additionally, this is a community subreddit unaffiliated in an official capacity with block.one\n\n___\n\n\n**Method #1**: MetaMask (recommended)\n\nVideo guide: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K1Q5hX_4-o\n\nsteemit tutorial: https://steemit.com/eos/@ash/full-walkthrough-how-to-join-eos-ico\n\n**Method #2**: MyEtherWallet\n\nsteemit tutorial: https://steemit.com/eos/@sandwich/contributing-to-eos-token-sale-with-myetherwallet-and-contract-inner-workings\n\n**Method #3**: Exodus Wallet\n\nOfficial website tutorial: http://support.exodus.io/article/65-i-ve-received-eos-tokens-in-exodus-how-do-i-register-them\n\n**Important note courtesy of /u/dskvry bka [Sandwich](https://steemit.com/@sandwich), the author of Method #2's steemit tutorial**:\n\n> claimAll will not work for most users. When you get to the claim step, please use the following tutorial: https://steemit.com/eos/@koyn/minimizing-the-cost-of-gas-when-claiming-eos-using-myetherwallet\n\n___\n\n\n**Did you buy your EOS tokens on an exchange? (Courtesy of /u/IQOptionCoin)**\n\n>**REMEMBER YOU ONLY NEED TO REGISTER YOUR TOKENS IF YOU BOUGHT THEM ON AN EXCHANGE. YOU DON'T NEED TO CLAIM THEM.**\n\n>1. Go to the EOS website https://eos.io\n\n>2. Scroll down and select \"GET EOS\"\n\n>3. Tick all the required boxes and click \"Continue\"\n\n>4. Scroll down and click \"Register\"\n\n>5. Select Metamask, MyEtherWallet, or Ethereum Wallet\n\n>6. Follow the guide.\n\n>7. Remember that the reason you need to register your Ethereum ERC-20 address is to include your EOS tokens in order for the balance of your EOS Tokens to be included in the Snapshot if a Snapshot is created, you must register your Ethereum address with an EOS public key. The EOS snapshot will take place prior to the 1 June 2018. After this point your ERC-20 EOS tokens will be frozen. And you will be issued EOS tokens on the EOS blockchain.\n\n>**So PLEASE REGISTER your Ethereum address NOW, don't forget about it, or plan on doing it some time in the near future.**\n\n___\n\nThere are a lot of submissions about this in /r/eos, so rather than making a new one please reply to this thread with any questions you may have.  Don't forget to join the EOS mailing list: https://eos.io/#subscribe and join the EOS community on your platform(s) of choice: [Telegram](https://t.me/joinchat/AAAAAEQbOeucnaMWN0A9dQ), [Discord](http://eos.social/) and/or [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/eosblockchain).\n\nAnd remember, if anyone instructs you to transfer ETH to an EOS contract address that doesn't match the address found on https://eos.io you are being scammed.\n\n\n",

I hope this community is not toxic or censored like Bitcoin is.\n\nFirst a bit of history...\nI joined the crypto space around 2013, bought my first bitcoin, bought feather coin etc.\nSold everything after a couple of months and then just left the space.\n\nThen when Ethereum bounced up in the beginning of the year I started looking more and more into cryptocurrencies again. I was older and a lot wiser than back in 2013 and saw a shit ton of use-cases for Ethereum\n\nI also looked a Dash and the insane rise to 80-100$. \nI researched a short while and saw a lot of claims about a huge pre-mine.\nSome hidden code from the organization that could roll back the blockchain or something?\n\nSo everything really smelled fishy and didn't really investigate further. \nBut now I realise I probably didn't do much research. I blindly followed Reddit comments from the Bitcoin subreddit, from Ethtrader etc. I was inexperience and me following these claims might have been a mistake.\n\nSo recently my interest for Dash hasgrown and the idea around the DAO is very interesting. I didn't even knew about the DAO when I dismissed Dash those months ago.\n\n\nSo now my question for you guys. What is up about this pre-mine? How big is it? Is it real? And if it is, is it really a problem?\n\nWhat is that rumor about hidden code or something to manipulate the blockchain? Is there actually a masterkey to change everything?\n\n\nI'm not shilling or trying to spread FUD. I really want some valid information from you guys about Dash. \nOf course I will take every comment with a grain of salt. Won't make the same mistake again. But I want to hear your opinions.",

I'm focusing on the fundamentals right now, like what is a Blockchain and all that, and how mining works etc. \n\nBut obviously a significant topic of conversation at the moment is the bitcoin coin split. I've read about this topic too, of course, but I'm finding the things I've read don't seem to square with the massive amount of hate that seems to exist between the two camps. I go to this subreddit and it's pretty open disdain for those who support BCH and I go to r/btc and it's vice versa. \n\nI'm trying to understand the mutual hatred here. A technical change like a fork and a decision between bigger and smaller blocks doesn't seem like something that would necessarily infused with such mutual hatred.... but here we are.\n\nTo try and understand this a bit more - including the politics behind the divide - does anyone have any articles they've come across that they have found explains the issue well? Even if it is one-sided, if it defends its position we'll, I'd still be interested in reading it, while keeping in mind the bias of the writer.\n\nI'm just trying to understand the situation more, so any link to articles you have found helpful would be much appreciated!!\n\nEdit 1: Holy crap!

So trust me; I'm making my way through all of this!  \n\nI also want to say - for such a contentious topic (where it is clear there is a lot of history and where many of you have thrown in with one lot or the other) - thank you for keeping things civil here, as well as doing your best to help a person new to all this inform himself.  Sometimes, from the outside looking in, the 'big-blocker vs. small-blocker' dispute seems a bit like the United Atheist Alliance going to war against the Allied Athiest Alliance, so I greatly appreciated the opportunity you have all given me to inform myself and come to my own evaluation of what is going on. So again, thank you.   I didn't expect a response quite this awesome, and I think the fact that there is so much here is a testament to how good this community really is. At this point, the thread has taken on a life of its own, and I feel that as bitcoin and cryptomarkets grow, this thread is going to help quite a few of us curious souls new to all this wandering in from the cold.  \n\nSo again, to everyone who took the time to contribute here, thank you, and may Satoshi him(her?)-self smile upon your good fortune.\n\nEdit 2: I would also just like to say two more quick things.  First, I hope you don't mind if I ask questions below to some of you in places where I am a bit unclear about things.  And second, I'm just going to preemptively reiterate: I am new to all this, and am not on any one 'side'; in my questions I may make statements as I attempt to clarify things for myself, and those statements may either be supporting or attacking your 'side', but that is only because I'm trying to understand, and not because I am actually on one 'side' or the other.",

The basis for the creation of Bytecoin was the CryptoNote unique technology | https://cryptonote.org/.\n\nFrom this moment on, the official Bytecoin team will be making an effort to be more transparent to the community.\nWe've been following all the activity in the community and we know you've been waiting for us to make a public statement. We see that there are lots of questions and we are now here to answer.\n\nBut firstly let me express my gratitude to all those enthusiasts who have made such valuable contributions to the development of BCN.\nWe are so grateful for all the work put in by @Leogheo and BFB program team, @kinlakinla for the Bytecoin info page, @GaboCarranza and @sydney40 for Bytecointalk activity, @july for the Telegram channel, @boomworking for help with the design and @Camilo_Gil for your sincere appeal to our team.\nThanks to the entire community for your trust and support even when you didn't hear from us. Only with your support  we were able to keep up our strength and continue working.\n\nJust a few words about our history, Bytecoin is the first coin developed under the cryptonote protocol, but due to the fragmented nature of the community, BCN was forked a million times. You know that sometimes we were criticized for \u201cslow development\u201d, but the truth is that when the others were spending time on marketing, we were putting all our effort into enhancing the already existing cryptocurrency ecosystem.\n\nIn any case, we're still here and we're looking to grow. We would like to invite the best cryptographers, developers, bright minds and passionate hearts to join our BCN team to create absolutely new and exciting developments - get ready for the BCN of the new era. To ensure our success in this new era, we'll need to support and trust each other and make our community even stronger.\n\nStarting now, we are open for communication. Feel free to share your thoughts, bugs and features with us. Please send all feedback to contact@bytecoin.org and we'll get back to you asap.\nWe will do our best to bring the best ideas to life.\n\nLet\u2019s start a new chapter of Bytecoin together!",

Then perhaps you will grow some credibility."

It's an unique thing and details are not available. \n\n- smart contracts are in development. ETA is this year. It will be done not like eth smart contracts, but done in functional programming paradigm/style.\n\n- Max Minchenkov said that IOTA are doing a solution together with CISCO for an undisclosed oil company, where IOTA will provide software and CISCO hardware. No ETAs or any other info. \n\n- Ternary hardware is still in development. It will be ternary CPU and Li-Fi. No ETAs or any other info. \n\n- Cfb is more on hardware part now, other team members do work on IRI. \n\nI can verify that people do build their own stuff on IOTA, personally saw a few teams today that build something on IOTA. And real word development on IOTA do happens outside of \"crypto community\". So the fact that it's quite in bitcointalk or even media means nothing. Work do progressing behind the doors. \n\nI talked personally with Cfb. He is a very polite and intellegent person.

[Enroll in Test Flight](https://www.Neodius.io)\n\n# About Neodius\nDue to the lack of mobile insights on your NEO and GAS assets; I've decided to create my own. Called **Neodius**.\n\nNeodius was built with the idea to have a better insight into your Neo Crypto Assets (love those hypie words :). Since NEO has that awesome GAS (neotogas.com click on about), it's good to see how much you have and how much you can claim. But most importantly, you want to know how many beers you can buy with your NEO \ud83c\udf7a. So i have implemented an automatic conversion from NEO to a (realistic) fiat value and a lot more features.\n\nNow most of you may ask, why not build a fully function wallet system in the first place. Good question: Well that has to do with Apple guidelines: The guidelines do not allow for \"non-accepted cryptocurrency payments\". Which are performed by a \"Fully functional wallet\". So NEO isn't yet an allowed Currency, but i'm currently working on getting NEO to be accepted on the App Store. However, I'm still waiting on a message from the App Store review team.\n\n**[Press display images](https://github.com/ITSVision/Neodius/blob/master/Artwork/Press%20Displays/press-displays.md)**\n\nFeatures currently are:\n\n* Multi-wallet\n* View your amount of NEO\n* View your GAS\n* View your unclaimed gas\n* View NEO value in BTC/ETH\n* View NEO value in fiat currencies ([View currencies](https://github.com/ITSVision/Neodius/blob/master/Neodius/Supporting%20Files/SettingCache/fiatCurrencies.json))\n* Automatic refreshing of your wallet. Fun for real-time stats\n* Securing Neodius with a passcode or TouchID\n* Quick address lookup\n* Quick transaction lookup\n* QRCode for your address.\n* Switch between MainNet and TestNet\n* View market information on GAS and NEO\n\t* Bid/ask prices\n\t* Current market (cap, volume, position)\n\t* Changes (1h, 24h, 7d)\n\t* Gauge showing current position on 24h tradingview\n* Scanning QR-Codes to add a wallet\n* GAS Calculation from a wallet or a user decided amount\n* View news from NEONewsToday.com\n* On-the-fly language switching, without restarting the app!\n* Supported languages:\n\t* \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\uddf3  Chinese (Simplified) -

        "post_body": "Dear EOS Community,\n\nWe have some exciting updates for you all.\n\nWe\u2019ve been working day and night the past few weeks, which has resulted in us not being communicative as we\u2019d like. We\u2019ve added three people to our marketing and communications team, so you can expect more consistent updates from now on! Without further ado:\n\n## Dividends will start accruing today, with the first payout in November!\n\nThis means that starting today, we will begin \u201ccounting\u201d all revenue. 20% of revenue will be retained for the bankroll and operating costs, and 80% will automatically be sent to BET token holders using a trustless smart contract. Dividends are already accruing, and the 30,000 EOS we\u2019ve made in profit today is yours! Please check the **eosbetdivs11** account for your dividend payout for today! This account will always have the latest dividend pool if you\u2019re curious\u00a0:)\n\nDividends are simple. If you own 1% of BET tokens, then you will receive 1% of net profit from the casino. If the casino made 100,000 EOS in a week, then you would receive 1,000 EOS at the end of that week. The more tokens you hold, the more dividends you will receive.\n\nAll dividends will be paid out automatically to your EOS account. There will be no claiming necessary, just a simple EOS payment directly to your wallet. All of our games will result in dividends. We are going to have much more than a simple dice game and BET holders will be rewarded very handsomely.\n\nIn the first 5 weeks of our operation, we made approximately **555,000 EOS**. This first month of profit will be devoted toward our bankroll, however every future month profit will be sent straight to BET holders as dividends. We are just getting started, thank you for being a part of the most profitable decentralized app in existence, and get ready for your dividends!\n\n## More Info\n\nDuring our first month, it was paramount that we grew the bankroll as quickly as possible. This allowed us to cater towards large bettors, who persistently asked us to raise the maximum bet. Just yesterday we paid out **13,491 EOS** to a whale on <51 roll, something that wouldn\u2019t be possible without a substantial bankroll. Profit has also skyrocketed with a larger bankroll, and our immense bankroll size benefits **all** BET token holders!\n\nAlthough we plan to continue raising the bankroll, it is somewhat less important right now, since it is already so large. Therefore, dividends are being accrued immediately, and will be paid out by November. We will continue growing the bankroll with any and all company EOS.\n\nWhy the wait the until November? Well, we need to perfect the dividend payout smart contract, and have it audited by multiple 3rd parties. If development is quicker, then it\u2019s possible that dividends will be paid out sooner. Also, our key development priorities for October include two new games and an innovative user on-boarding system. (More about these soon.)\n\n# Other Updates\n\n## Consensus Singapore, EOS Hackathon, and Blockchain Live\n\nWe had team members present at these three fantastic events. The EOS Hackathon in London was particularly rewarding: we met with over a dozen block producers, hired several top developers, and met with key members of the EOS community, including block.one and EOS VC. *Dan Larimer also thanked us for building on EOS and proving the power of the blockchain to the world!*\n\nTeam members also met with a number of potential strategic investors who are interested in long-term partnerships with EOSBet.\n\n## New games, features, and user on-boarding processes\n\nWe have two new games under development. We don\u2019t want to make them public quite yet, but we think the community will enjoy them. Now that we\u2019ve expanded the development team, we\u2019re also working on new features for Dice, additional wallet/exchange integrations, and a novel system for user on-boarding.\n\n## Wallet Integrations\n\nWe\u2019ve now integrated with EOS Lynx, Token Pocket, EOSex, MoreWallet, MathWallet, and many more to come! All our games will always be mobile-compatible since we know you guys love playing on Android & iOS.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nOur vision is to create the first mainstream blockchain-based casino, one that is decentralized, trustless, and returns profit back to token holders. We\u2019ve been working hard each day to achieve this vision. Every decision that our team makes is made for the lasting benefit of the community, since we will be here together for the long-term. Our global community is very important to us, and you are all championing the effort to make sure that we all remain #1 in this space.\n\nThanks for joining us on this journey and being part of something special.\n\nSincerely,\n\nThe EOSBet Team",

There's only been people here and on XMR trader shouting for months that exchanges directly invovled with new Tether prints are probably fractionally reserved. We've been explaining that they're probably using any real Monero on their exchanges to maintain leveraged shorts with price suppression. And that's in addition to the naked short that selling non-existent Monero actually is.\n\nIf you leave your XMR on BitFinex, Poloniex, Binance, Huobi, or any exchange that receives new Tether prints, you're hurting us. Use a *reputable* regulated exchange if you're gonna trade. Kraken is probably the best here, and they're very likely fully reserved. They're trying to integrate into the banking system, and generally can't afford to do those kinds of manipulation and lies.\n\nOr just use a decentralized exchange. Or better yet, *stop trading.* Most people get rekt doing it. We need to squeeze the shit out of liquidity on these price manipulators. It's time to put an end to this. They don't have loads of ASIC mined and premined Monero to dump on retail. They hate that they can't see the onchain flows. They want to suppress price and make Monero their own personal little laundromat.\n\nMonero is for *The People* not for a narrow set of corporate parasites. Pull your damn coins OFF of the exchanges.\n\nDo it NOW.\"",

The people that post the garbage posts get recognition and first page placement because everyone feels the need to comment on their posts giving them the glory they wanted in the first place. Wouldn't it be better to just let them bitch in silence and complain and just down vote them, instead of rallying the entire community around their post? Their entire goal is to cause people to fear and make our value go down, so why give them the recognition in the first place.

        "post_body": "Answers are directly copied from the two devs themselves, other than for some minor spelling corrections. Enjoy!\n##Roadmap:\nWe've already finished the features such as digital asset, digital identity, smart contract, complier and dev pack for C# /VB.NET/F#/Java/Kotlin. And in the end of 2017, we gonna finish the yellowpaper and incubat more project of DApp and then we will improve the implementation of smart contract development by Java/Kotlin. At the beginning of 2018, NeoX, NeoFS, NeoQs are our most important works.\n\nPriorities until 2018 = for (int i=0; i<3; i++) printf (\u201cNeoContract Ecosystem\u201d);\n\t\n##Biggest Competitor: \n1. I think Ethereum should be our biggest competitor at the moment. They have the first mover advantage and the complement community. For NEO, at least, we have three kinds of advantage: 1. Better architecture: it helps us to make a better future 2. More developer-friendly smart contract:  it can be easy for us to construct the ecosystem. 3. Digital identity and digital assets: helps us to combine with the real life easily.\n2. NEO will not win wars fighting with Alipay or WePay for existing market. Blockchain will thrive in completely new areas, and these areas will become mainstream sooner or later.\n\n##NEO lightning network / sidechains / custom VMs similar to EVM: \n1. Current NEO network can handle 1000 TPS with 15-20 seconds for final confirmation. We are not desperately in need of state channels.\n2. Let's get more dApps running before worried about bloating.\n3. We have NeoVM with high performance, low coupling and high scalability, which is fundamentally different from EVM.\n\n##Regulating scam ICOs on NEO: \nHow to regulate ICO is a hot topic in the Chinese blockchain industry and community. The head of Digital Currency Institute at PBOC (central bank) recently published an article on ICO regulations. He said the regulating authority should rather be the gatekeeper than scavenger. Pre-screening or licensing may huddle innovation, so the regulators should pay close attention to those ICOs but only step in when needed. We think this standpoint is well balanced between flexibility and legitimacy. If any ICO project looks like a Ponzi scheme or scam, we will warn the public and regulators may step in.\n\n##Possible government regulation in China: \nI don\u2019t think it is what we should worry. NEO has digital identity module built in. Everything we do we make sure it is compliant.\n\nIn addition, NEO is becoming one of the most internationally known open-source project originated from China. I think the government will love what we did. Besides, Onchain had been providing consulting service for several local governments to use blockchain in society management.\n\nIf you read the whitepaper, you will see that anti-censorship, anonymity, unstoppable applications are not design goals of NEO. That's why we say NEO is for the smart ECONOMY.\n\nNEO as an open-source community project has no official relationship with Chinese government. Likewise, I don't know any other public blockchains have official relationship with their government.\n\n##Size of Dev team: \nThere are about half a dozen full-time developers here in Shanghai, among them two are core developers. We don\u2019t need tens of people doing protocol level development. Other than that, there are a few dozens more contributing code and ideas as community members, some of them are Onchain DNA developers. Besides we have a few academic researchers serving as technical advisors. By saying Core developer, we mean who has commit permission on GitHub. Bitcoin has 15 core developers as of today.\n\nErik Zhang insists on applying very strict definition on developers and core developers.\n\n##Relationship between Onchain and NEO: \nNEO is a community project. Onchain doesn't own NEO.\n\nNEO and Onchain are separate entities. NEO is a community driven/funded open-source project, while Onchain is a VC-backed company. The connections are:\n\n1. Two of the five co-founders of Onchain are also founders of NEO\n2. The consortium version of NEO, namely DNA, shares the same architect and smart contract system with NEO\n3. With NeoX, the cross-chain protocol, we are exploring the possibility of integrating permissionless blockchain (NEO) with permissioned ones (DNA).\n\n##Affiliation with Microsoft/Alibaba: \nThere is no direct cooperation between Alibaba and NEO/Onchain, other than their mailbox service is using Law Chain to provide attested email service. In terms of Microsoft, yes we have cooperation with Microsoft China because NEO is built with C# and .NET Core, and NeoContract is the first in the world to support writing smart contract with C#.\n\n##NeoQS / Sharding: \n1. The sign/verify algorithm has already been done. Good news is the speed is much quicker than ECC. Bad news is it takes substantial work to integrate into current ECC-based NEO system.\n2. Dynamic Sharding or concurrent ability lies on NEO's architectural design. We will write blogs in details in term of this issue in the future.\n\n##Marketing Plan: \nDA: The major one will be a NEO DevCon in Q4. Bay area might be a good place to hold the event.\n\nErik: My definition of marketing is how to attract the developers to work on NEO platform, making DApps and creating ecosystem.\n\n##Listing of NEO on more exchanges: \nAt this moment, we are actively working on the network upgrade. We definitely would like to see NEO being listed on more exchanges, especially the one caters different countries. It is up to the exchanges but we plan to reach out to them in the future. As a teaser, Erik and I are travelling to Japan in August.\n\n##On a lighter note:\n1. Da Hongfei and UFC (https://imgur.com/a/Mrav8)\n2. NEO can do almost anything, but it \"cannot wash T-shirts, cannot cook delicious\" (https://imgur.com/a/e59A5)\n",

        "post_body": "BSCArmy (Barmy) is the first DAO on BSC ecosystem that advocates for the adoption of the cryptocurrency in general and the BSC in particular. \n\n90% of Barmy token is released on TGE so both development team and investors have an equal chance to buy Barmy through IDO or a Dex such as SwapX or Pancakeswap. The interesting mechanism behind this potential gem is RFI static rewards, which basically means that remaining holders will receive 5% tax fee from any transaction. Therefore, the more Barmy held in your wallet, the more Barmy will come to you. \n\nBy doing so, Barmy shares the responsibilities for developing and thriving BSCArmy between dev team and holders. They all strive and work hard to achieve the Barmy mission that is to accompany BSC ecosystem through thick and thin. \n\nFor more information, you can find out in the links below. \n\nWhitepaper: https://docs.bsc.army/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/barmy_official\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/bscarmychannel\n\nListed on Coingecko: https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bscarmy\n\nHow to buy Barmy on TrustWallet: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW-atFXIOg8&list=PLJwVl7n4ISX7WlaazFve4-i3fkI-IhBFu",

We see a run up to .80 after the pandemic hysteria, just to get slapped with the SEC lawsuit, resulting in another precipitous drop to .20. I\u2019ve been able to DCA and double my bag while lowering my buy in price. So I\u2019m still up massively by conventional investment comparison. \n\nBut it\u2019s been tough. And as the end to the discovery phase of this lawsuit is approaching, I breathe a big sigh of relief. I really do think all of us resilient HODLERS will be rewarded in the end. \n\nTo all the XRP army, I commend you. We all know the fuckery that is happening at the SEC, and seeing other coins with less adoption and no utility moon, sucks.\n\nBut at this point the light at the end of the tunnel is approaching.",

Let's face it... not enough has been done since.  The only person I see out there being vocal on Dash is Max Keiser, and it's still his #2 crypto (to BTC).\n\nThere is zero reason why BCH and LTC should be ahead of Dash right now (and not only in market cap, but in r/ subscribers, twitter engagement, etc.)  I think the sole reason they are currently more valuable than Dash is because of their vocal leaders (Roger Ver, Charlie Lee).\n\nMy post in August was about needing Amanda.  But obviously it's not about Amanda - It's about having a STRONG voice on our side - which Amanda was.  She wasn't \"trolly\"... but she was forceful in her message.  Both blunt and logical.\n\nEvery time this topic gets brought up, all the comments are something to the effect of: \"Dash grows on fundamentals. We don't need a voice.\"  That's all fine and dandy, but why wouldn't Dash try its best to get its message out there?  There's quite literally no downside.\n\nWe're pushing up against another fork and scaling debate - and I see no content being pushed out there about 1) Dash governance preventing forks, 2) Dash's fluid block size, 3) why side-chains/lightning network don't solve scaling, 4) privatesend/instantsend, etc... \n\nDash content has been anemic for several months now - and I think it could easily be at least in the #3 crypto spot if its message matches its technology.

Many of these stores are also offering an exclusive additional 15% discount on orders paid with Monero. These stores in aggregate get millions and millions of impressions and every store customer will see Monero during checkout even if they end up paying with fiat currency. You can see all participating stores and artists at [ProjectCoralReef.com](http://projectcoralreef.com).\n\nThere are several reasons we went for musicians instead of trying to canvas something like Newegg. The first is that a lot of those stores already accept Bitcoin, which means you can already use Monero on them via xmr.to and similar. The second reason is that the Newegg target audience largely already know about Monero, or have at least heard of it. The third reason is that it\u2019s hard to incentivise people to purchase GPUs with Monero.\n\nMusic fans, on the other hand, are rabid. If they can save 15% on a purchase, or get something exclusive, but have to jump through hoops to do so they absolutely will. \"Tricking\" someone into using Monero is really the first step to their achieving financial sovereignty.\n\nWe\u2019re also aware that there are lots of pieces of the ecosystem that are weak, such as mobile wallet support and easy ways to purchase Monero, but many people are working on improving that status quo. And as these parts of the ecosystem are built out, there will be further interest from the same journalists who are reporting on Project Coral Reef right now.\n\nAnd, too, this is just stage 1. There will be more coming next year from the same team that put this together. The biggest thing that Coral Reef has given us is leverage, due to the high profile nature of it, and we will be using that leverage to open doors elsewhere. Stay tuned!\n\nLastly, I\u2019d like to give a VERY special thanks to all those that supported the crowdfunding campaign, without which this would not have been possible!",

The protocol is fixed and miners complete. Competition means innovation in both hardware and software. The current node software (if that's what it is when this goal is achieved) is essentially, from that point, a reference implementation only.\n\nThoughts?"

        "post_body": "Hi,\n\nto get right into it: as I stated a few months ago, the previously so called \"beta\" and later re-labelled Testnet would be nothing more than an alpha version of the Tron ecosystem.\n\nDon't get me wrong please, that's not a bad news, but there was some shilling at that time, people like me getting slammed rather labelling it as alpha as it was clear that this amount of work couldn't lead to a beta version (I won't explain the definition of Beta and Alpha here, please Google).\n\nHowever, to make clear what is currently possible with Testnet:\n\n - run a witness\n - run a full node\n - do transactions\n - make your own token (web interface buggy at the time of writing)\n - create a wallet\n\nWhat is NOT possible yet:\n\n - Dapps (coming after Mainnet release)\n - Contracts (coming after Mainnet release)\n\nSo the most interesting and most important features are NOT implemented yet, which makes it hard for developers like me to come up with contracts or Dapps right at the Mainnet launch. \n\nSo take this carefully into account before shilling again: There won't be no native 3rd party Dapps or contracts on Mainnet launch! \n\nThere probably will be a few Dapps from official Tron partners, but those I don't see as independent 3rd party developers.\n\nSo do NOT shill too much into it before Mainnet, not much will happen regarding the ecosystem or broader use yet or at the Mainnet launch.\n\nPersonally, I'd even consider the Mainnet launch in May as a \"Beta\" as contracts and Dapps won't be able to be fully tested and undiscovered issues won't pop-up before the launch.\n\nSee in you May!\n\nPS: if you want to run your own full node, you will need to have a significant amount of TRX at hand and witnesses that vote for you or your node to become a representative.\n\n",

This has been more or less since the birth of the network so they are a very knowledgeable team. Although you may not know the parent company you may of heard of LOBSTR & StellarTerm both of which are some of the first trading clients that many people used to use the stellar network.\n\nI believe LOBSTR is called such because before being called XLM the native tokens were called stellars or STR on the original network so LOB - to move & STR - stellars. To Move Stellars. So that\u2019s testament right there to how long these guys have been working on the network.\n\nOn 30th November 2020 Ultra Stellar acquired another Stellar trading client, StellarX, from Coinsquare. A new comer to the network StellarX struggled to make traction although it has proved to be a great client to access the Stellar Network.\n\nAlthough not directly linked to SDF Ultra Stellar does work closely with them. We saw this only this week when the validators went down and SDF & LOBSTR worked together to get their validators back online. Ultra Stellar has won multiple Community Fund rounds and have a lot of networking within the Stellar community."

Can we stop that?\n\nWhales are keeping us artificially low. If we ever want to break out and get real attention, we need to keep news focused. Do not try to turn every poop news into some big shit, because people will get bored, when \"big news\" become daily business, but nothing else happens. We need to keep it low, focus on the long term and don't go after fast gains, because those won't just happen when you think you can sell poop for cake. Ppl will figure it out at some point and might leave.\n\n\nKeep your focus, and do not look after all the opportunities out there.\n\nHere are some facts to calm you all down:\n\n- Just wait for the big news. We are basically the first coin that gets the official (and inoffical) attention of GLOBAL players... Not just startups like they appear on other coins (just for their own marketing), but BIG companies.\n- Patience is key! I learned that on LTC last year. Lost big time because I missed some bigger pumps because of day trading. The FUD was real.\n- We mooned quite hard before a short time, there are dip phases. But look, we are still x10 from before some weeks. This support level is a strong signal. If you are sad that it dropped from 5$ to 3$, don't worry. That happens everywhere. Weakhands will be shaken out.\n- IOTA is one of the big winners 2018, although it's already high up. I go even as far as saying, that it is the ethereum of this year.\n- IOTA has a team size of over 30 people. If you follow their slack channel, you see how fast new tools come out and how much progress they make in this short amount of time.\n- The IOTA team has the right focus. They want business attention and they are at the moment the ones that do this best!\n- The issues were not (mainly) architectural problems. The biggest problems ATM are UX related. But keep in mind, that this whole tangle thing is new and brings a lot of complexity. A lot of the current problems will be solved by developer-time and adoption.\n- As soon as the trinity wallet comes out (formerly UCL wallet), this coin will literally be usable by each and everyone without any tangle-based context knowledge.\n- We are early adopters in the tangle world. If you are an early adopter, stuff usually doesn't run smooth. But you usually get a high return, since you invest in a new and risky tech.\n- IOTA is, for myself, the most riskfree coin for this year, promising high returns.\n- Whales try to keep the price artificially low. Why? Because there are not much tangle based coins out there. Whales want to speculate. They need to be able to spread fear over the market, to make their big gains. They see the potential in IOTA / the tangle and they understand, that IOTA basically solved ALL major problems of bitcoin, like scalability, trx-speed, fees and quantum computer resistance. Those are MAJOR problems of all blockchain based coins, and IOTA solves them all at once, where other coins tried to just do some parts a bit better.\n- This is just an opinion I believe in, observing the markets in the past month: Whales weren't able to control Rai and IOTA both, so they focused on IOTA. Although there were some massive attack-attempts on Rai, it didn't change much. My guess is that they gave up at some point. Everyone know that the real tangle-pusher is IOTA.\n\nIOTA is the big winner of 2018, and as soon as the big news drop, there will be nothing whales can do than to jump on and to try to sell again higher. In the meantime, don't make a big deal out of every tiny little tweet, that won't help.\n\n\n**TL;DR:**\n\n- IOTA team has the head on the right spot.\n- Big business players, that no other coin can show (except some companies that invented their own coins)\n- This coin solves ALL of bitcoins major problems without any real competitor\n- Whales fear IOTA, for a reason.\n- Updates and tools come out on a daily basis and the difficulty to get into IOTA decreases daily.\n- IOTA will be the big shit this year, but do expect a huge load of FUD. I really think that setting a goal for yourself and just not paying any attention to what is happening, has the highest chance of return by the end of the year.\n- Be patient and sit it out.\n\nPS: Sorry, english is not my native language.\n\nPPS: I love the community and the help I receive everywhere. Running my own node and I'm glad to be part of this rocket! :)",

        "post_title": "TRON Community Node",
        "post_body": "The TRON Community Node Project (v. 2.0 - TGNT token removed)\n\n\nOn May 31, 2018, Tron Labs will launch the Main Net and thus transition the TRX cryptocurrency away from the Ethereum blockchain to one managed by Tron Labs. Beginning On June 25th, the TRX coinholders will vote in daily elections to choose 27 organizations to run their blockchain network. These organizations will become Super Representatives who operate computer servers called 'nodes.'\n\nTron Labs will pay these nodes 32 TRX coins for every block of data produced. The 27 nodes will take turns creating these blocks at the rate of 1 per second, or about 2 blocks each per minute.\n\nThat's a little more than 2,750,000 TRX per day at an average of about 100,000 TRX per Super Representative.\n\nThe Super Representatives will earn TRX daily, but in order to maintain elected power those Super Representatives must provide benefits to the TRX voters who elected them. In addition to benefitting the Tron community with support initiatives, a Super Representative may wish to share its rewards directly with the TRX voters who elect it every day. \n\nI am already running a cloud based node on the test net, with a focus on uptime and reliability. I hope to meet the performance levels sufficient to get my node voted into the group of candidates for Super Representative, after which the node may or may not enter rotation as an earning Super Representative. \n\nOriginally I had welcomed the notion of taking a seat at the table next to other members of the TRON community, then I realized there probably won't be room for even one of us. \n\nAnd then I wondered, \n>'Since a TRON Network Super Representative is actually a collection of people backed by an organization, what if the members of the Reddit, Twitter, and YouTube community banded together to become a Super Representative?' \n\nThere won't be a seat at the table for any one of us, but perhaps there's one for all of us. Alone we each stand zero chance of winning an election, but together we can vote ourselves in.\n\nThis is not a novel idea. Several other groups have formed with similar intentions, with different rewards plans being developed. Anticipating this, I have set this project apart from the others by proposing an **open source** structure for the management and ownership of the organization.\n\nTo run a Super Representative node, the Tron Foundation recommends a technical budget of $40,000 per month - a substantial investment for a startup. I have devised a plan to bootstrap our operation and to start I am paying out of pocket for the server's introductory level operation.  I have a plan to scale the server size according to its growing predominance, and have already increased the provisioning twice. If elected to one of these exclusive Super Representative posts I will be able to scale up what I believe will be a reasonably acceptable server instance within 10 minutes.\n\nThis will be my test for viability of the server.  If it succeeds, then we get to move on to the next phase of the plan. If it is woefully inadequate and fails to produce blocks when given the chance, then I will have lost a small sum and a considerable amount of time.\n\nIf the node is successful in earning block rewards, we will implement a voter rewards program. Please take a moment to review our [Rewards Proposal](https://github.com/bondibox/community-node/blob/master/doc/rewards_plan.md).\n\nIn a nutshell, while some Super Representatives will choose to reward the voters who elected them, we will create a market for buying votes.\n\nThe organization will have several responsibilities, both social and financial. Primarily it must maintain a reliable Full Node on the TRON blockchain. After core expenses are met, the community has several long-term considerations. \n\nThe Tron ecosystem will rely on application developers to create a need for TRX coins. Without applications, our investment in TRX will languish and become worthless. As partners in the Tron foundation, a Super Representative must be proactive in developing the Tron community through advocacy, advertisement, and applications. Spending money on these initiatives is not altruism, it is a self-serving gesture for the benefit of all TRX coinholders. We will prioritize the development of these initiatives in the early days of Tron main net so as to drive excitement and public awareness for the project.\n\nAfter these responsibilities have been met, we can open our treasury to the voters who make it possible for us to continue operations, sending them TRX rewards as a dividend for their participation.\n\nOur Mission is to become an intellectual asset for the community. The Tron project itself is open source, and we expect other cryptocurrencies to use the Tron application as a starting point for their blockchain networks. Other Distributed Proof of Stake cryptocurrencies may adopt Tron's Super Representative structure, and those Super Representatives will be creating organizations very similar to ours.\n\nWe chose to make our project Open Source in order to provide a resource for those who come after us. We are indeed pioneers in a brave new world and many will follow in our footsteps. Let us light their way.\n\nYou are encouraged to join us and become a part of our group. It's people just like you who we want to include in this effort. Thanks!\n\nWebsite:\n[tron.communitynode.org](http://tron.communitynode.org)\n\nTelegram:\n[TRON Community Node & Super Representative](https://t.me/CommunityNode)\n\nTwitter:\n[@community_node](https://twitter.com/community_node)\n\n",

        "post_title": "APEX, the next big NEO ICO - a summary of the project that will disrupt a $200 billion business",
        "post_body": "APEX is a blockchain-powered data and interactions exchange that passes value and data ownership back to the consumer, as well as increasing marketing efficiency, data quality, and customer loyalty for the enterprise.\n\n\n\n**Problem:**\n\nConsumer data is collected daily by 3rd party data providers and sold to companies for research and marketing purposes. Your consent to collect, use and sell your data is often obtained when you agree with the complicated Terms and Conditions documents before you make use of a platform. \n\n\nEnterprises that purchase consumer data from 3rd parties often run into data quality issues, and don\u2019t know if this data has been obtained legally.\n\n\nThe GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) will roll out on May 25, 2018 globally, which will introduce stricter regulation regarding the collection, use and sale of your personal data by enterprises. The GDPR will give citizens back control of their own.\n\n\n**Solution:**\n\n\nAPEX, a B2C platform that will allow consumers to sell their data to marketers, satisfying both ends of the transaction in this very niche market. Consumers interact with the Consumer Client App, where they have full control of their data and who can use it. Consumers decide with which brands they wish to share their data and what kind of data will be shared. The consumers are rewarded with CPX and which they can use to purchase rewards or sell on the open market. The APEX platform is a disruptive technology that will cut out middlemen like Acxiom, which is a 3rd party data provider that never shares profits with consumers and will be fairly impacted by the new GDPR regulation. APEX also provides consumers and enterprises new channels to directly interact with each other. These channels will save enterprises billions of advertising dollars annually as they can directly engage with their target audience.\n\n\nEnterprises connect through the APEX platform via the Enterprise Client App named NEXUS. This is an already existing and working platform with more than 250 enterprise clients. NEXUS enables brands to manage target customer scope, data acquisition scope, cost management, rewards engagements. Enterprises are then able to analyse and activate the data collected by using features such as real time advanced analytics and productized machine learning and AI models. NEXUS is built on top of Azure (Microsoft) and AWS (Amazon) cloud computing services to process the massive data at scale\n\n\nTo grow the ecosystem, APEX will provide partners and brands a SDK that consumers can use to connect with the APEX platform via the partner's or brand's platform. The NEXUS API will allow enterprises to connect to the APEX platform with their own application or platform.\n\n\n**Blockchain Technology:**\n\nThe consent by consumers to use their data and their CPX tokens as reward for sharing their data will be automatically logged and executed by smart contracts on the NEO blockchain without any middle men. By using blockchain technology the APEX platform also ensures that it will adhere to the upcoming GDPR as all consents of consumers are logged in smart contracts on the blockchain. NEO's efficient dBFT consensus mechanism and its built-in identity features will be useful for the long-term development of APEX.\n\n\n\n**The Company:**\n\nThe company behind APEX is Chinapex which is an existing data technology and AI company headquartered in Shanghai with offices in Beijing, Hong Kong and Silicon Valley. Chinapex has served more than 200 enterprise clients such as Standard Chartered, BMW, Hilton, Chevrolet and Casio. The core team comprises of high capable members who have worked for large corporates like Microsoft and Alibaba. The company was also selected for Microsoft Accelerator Shanghai as one of 15 out of 1000 companies.\n\n\n\n**Partnerships:**\n\nAPEX has a received a large number of free Azure credits (worth $500,000 USD) from Microsoft/Microsoft Azure to deploy their off-chain solution on their cloud. APEX also has a cross-selling and marketing partnership with Azure's Business Development and Marketing teams. Azure's team receives commissions on customer acquisition for APEX.\n\n\nAPEX has a similar partnership with AWS China (Amazon). AWS provides APEX with brands from retail, automotive and financial services and in exchange APEX will deploy a part of its system on AWS.\n\n\nAlibaba Cloud has an agreement with APEX which works in a similar fashion. In addition, they provide APEX access to their platform named 'Databank', which gives APEX access to 500 million unique ecommerce user data. APEX can use this data for data enrichment and verification.\n\n\nAPEX has a commercial partnership with Oracle Marketing Cloud China where they share and cross-sell brand customers. Joint customers are for example Maserati and Ferrari. The NEXUS platform of APEX has an API integration with Oracle Marketing Cloud's Eloqua such that brands can effectively use data acquired from APEX on the Oracle cloud. \n\n\nBaidu and APEX have an API partnership for search and display advertising as of Q3 2017. It enables NEXUS and APEX enterprise users to interact with consumers on the APEX Network on all search and display channels of Baidu. Baidu has the largest search engine market share in China (76.05% as of April 2017).\n\n\nTencent is an API partner which gives APEX access to Tencent's QQ display media assets, WeChat, and Tencent's display network outside of QQ and WeChat. QQ and WeChat are instant messaging platforms with 850 million and 963 million monthly active user accounts respectively (Q2 2017).\n\n\nLastly, data collaboration partnerships were announced with Red Pulse (Financial Information) and Bongmi (Healthtech).\n\n\n\nWebsite:\n\n\nApex.chinapex.com\n\n\nWhitelist is opening very soon. Will likely close within an hour (only 5.000 spots left)",

On the one hand I think \"haha let em get rekt\" but on the other I just hate to see our precious space go to the proverbial dogs and have to listen to every Tom Dick and Harry on their opinions about coins. One of my friend last night (who has never been involved with crypto before) asked me if I was in on a coin called CUMMIES, I looked it up, its literally called CumRocket (CUMMIES) and this dude was taking it seriously, I just wanted to curl up in a ball and dissolve away so I don't have to deal with everyone's nonsense, especially as I just know everyone I know will start bugging me when the true mania kicks in soon.\n\nAnyway, just wanted to vent.

        "post_title": "ETN IS STILL IN PRE-SEASON",
        "post_body": "Hi guys,\n\nFirst of all, I would like to say that this writing of mine is not intended to create a massive swarm of negative comments and start an inner fight within our community, we are better than that. This piece is intended to inspire and help all of us keep our heads up even though we are going through a tough time.\n\nI just want to write a piece of encouragement for all ETN holders out there.\n\nThe badly timed and delayed listing on Coinbene followed by the low volume of trade on it have created a fud and quite a negative feeling towards ETN overall. We can even see a negative side of our community taking shape in the form of overprotective and \u201ctribal\u201d individual voicing their opinions. Everyone if free to state their mind, but not every mind is the right one to represent the voice and will of our community, and the reputation of ETN overall\n\nFirst off, I would like to say that the bearish market is one of the reasons why ETN has dropped. Where BTC goes, almost everyone goes. But I think that another reason why ETN is dropping is because of weak hands selling off their coins to cut losses. I don\u2019t blame them for doing it, it is their livelihood they\u2019re putting at risk and looking after our own personal financial interest is what everyone should do.\n\nNow I believe that the biggest reason why ETN hasn\u2019t had a positive outlook pricewise is because most of the crypto world has put the wrong lens on the coin. Let me explain.\n\nEveryone bought in on the coin because of its potential. The aim for mass adoption through banking the unbanked, enabling a trillion dollar market, deploying an instant payment system for vendors to accept ETN, an easy and simple mobile phone app allowing no one but myself to look at and access my coins, a strong and efficient blockchain allowing transfers of coins between ETN wallet holders (individuals and entities), the fast rise of active users, the air-drop of free coins through the simulated app. Everything the project has come up with is absolutely a positive aspect of the coin, enabling its fast viral growth over the last year.\n\nNow the mistake that a lot of people did was to apply the same judgmental \u201cprocedure\u201d on ETN that they put on well established 4-5 years old coins. As a matter of fact, many other coins in the space is suffering from the same ordeal. That is; **the coin is still in its \u201cpre-season\u201d phase, and people are heavily giving it the same treatment as a coin well advanced into its season.**\n\nSport commentators and pundits all know that it is wrong to judge a team that is still in pre-season; working hard day-in-and-day-out, training for hours for the upcoming though road that is to come. There are ups and downs like we've all seen during this period of building, training and fine tuning. They know that the real opinionated judgement of a team/athlete\u2019s performances doesn\u2019t really start until after the season kicks in, after a few games have been played. They don\u2019t make hasty conclusion based off of what happened last week during bootcamp.\n\nElectroneum is just like that. And let me tell you why. ETN\u2019s goal is to achieve mass adoption through the creation, deployment and implementation of three main components. The first one is the mobile app that comes with the online wallet that no one else but the owner can access, this app also allows the transfer of funds through its strong blockchain between ETN active users. The second is the vendors\u2019 instant payment system API, allowing transaction between businesses and customers, and creating a velocity of the ETN coin across the world. The third one is reaching its target markets through marketing and smart contracts signed with multimillion dollar companies. As of today, ETN is barely into their second component, their API system is barely out as a beta version, intended for collecting helpful data that could help further the development of its full version. The third component, the marketing to reach out to the targeted market hasn\u2019t even begun yet, because the instant payment hasn\u2019t been fully deployed to vendors, although transaction between individual users is enabled and functioning correctly. What would be the point to reach out to over 300 million people just to tell them that they cannot fully use ETN in their current mainstream market? Failure would surely follow.\n\nETN is not fully into its season until they have opened the gates on the multiple fronts they are aiming to venture into. As long as those three components haven\u2019t been fully opened and accessed by the intended actors, ETN will remain in its building stage, its \u201cpre-season\u201d phase. **The large majority of people in the cryptocurrency world think that just because a company have successfully created its blockchain technology, they have officially begun their campaign, but they are wrong**. **Many projects, if not, all projects come with more than a blockchain, there has to be a goal, a purpose to its existence. They come with alliances with other companies, extensions of their technologies like the mobile app, and implementation through paid and viral marketing to reach the intended targeted market.** ETN\u2019s true campaign will begin when the time comes where they have to use their muscles to handle the hundreds of thousands or even millions of transactions in a single day, created by the active transfer of ETN through its mobile wallet app **AND** API system found in various stores. Until then, the only thing we as a community should do is to cheer them on as they are about to tackle the upcoming season that is ahead.\n\nThat is the reason why I believe ETN is down pricewise. People are putting the wrong lens on it or have forgotten along the way that ETN is still in its pre-season phase. Let\u2019s all remain as the strong three arrow and stop this nonsense inner fighting between members of our community. It doesn\u2019t help us or the coin, if any, it gives ETN a bad reputation. Let's not forget that the current price has no direct influence on the amazing project overall. The team gets back up even stronger whenever there is a set-back and the project still stands above all else.\n\nSorry for the long writing and thanks for your time. Please share it to the community!!! People need to read this!!\n\nTHREE ARROWS!!!",

Back then everybody thought Bitcoin Cash was useless, nevertheless it had a good good price. 5 billion$ were created out of nothing. Since then the whole market pumped x5. This time it will even be more.\n\nShit forks like Bitcoin Gold with no usecase were born, and even this coin started with 500$ per coin. \n\nBitcoin Private forked of ZCL and BTC. So the ZCL price has nothing to do with the Bitcoin Private price. ZCL price was surpressed by trolls who spread FUD. And the FUD was big. Never seen such an amount of trolls. The fear it will overtake many other coins is very high.\n\nEverybody will use a private coin in the future. Nobody wants to show in public how many coins they have nor for what they spend their money. The same for businesses. They need to have private transactions.\n\nZk-snarks are the best privacy feature at the moment in the market, and in the AMA they even said they will update them in the next year to ZK-starks which will be even better.\n\nNot many Investors know what Monero verge etc are. They just see Bitcoin Brand and buy. \nThis is the first Bitcoin with zk snarks and has real usecases. Bitcoin Cash has also its usecase but it has no privacy.  \n\nThere have been claimed way less coins than anticipated which will make the price even higher. \n\nA realistic starting price is 400-700$. After that we will se what real FOMO looks like. Imagine going on coinmarketcap and suddently See a Bitcoin Private in the Top10. Who wouldnt fomo in?

Tin foil hat me, bro.\n\nSo, a few weeks ago, SWIFT just randomly stopped trying to build their own blockchain/ledger. I find it heavily suspect that such an absurdly large organization would simply give up on a technology that even they called \"encouraging\". What's odd is that this happened right around the same time that Brad said Ripple was going to stop announcing new banking partnerships. What if SWIFT actually just struck a deal with Ripple to leverage their technology (since they can't seem to build it) and they are currently merging their clients? This would solve SWIFT's tech problem and Ripple's bank relationship problem in one fell swoop.\n\nIt would also explain why Brad is so confident that they will be signing \"a bank a week\" because he knows that with SWIFT on their side, they have their foot in the door with ALL the banks, now it's just paperwork and logistics.\n\nIt would also explain why SWIFT tweeted today that their customers must \"change their interfaces and business systems\" by November. Maybe SWIFT is prepping to flip a switch and have the entire world banking system switch over to xCurrent with the option of using the cheaper and faster xRapid. Maybe, just maybe, SWIFT is full of smart people that know they aren't a Silicon Valley technology company and they would rather focus on their strong suit, banking relationships. Peanut butter, yo.\n\nIt would also explain u/bearableguy123's absurd price prediction of far over $100 in 2018. If his prediction is true, like his track record, Ripple HAS to be growing at an incredible rate behind the scenes and this seems like an obvious shortcut to be able to do so.\n\nMaybe the play isn't to replace SWIFT, it\"s to be SO much better, that you simply become SWIFT.\n\nTin foil hat, off; murderous comments, commence.",

        "post_body": "We\u2019re all bored until the next wave up, so let me explain why the price will go up big time. The only condition is xRapid being adopted, which clearly is happening, so the price will go up. Here is why (I am not a native speaker, so exuse me if my formulations are not very smooth).\n\n1) There is a limited number of XRPs and this number is going down (a tiny fraction of XRP being burned with every transaction). \n\n2) With an increasing volume of transactions and the amount of XRP going down, the value of XRP has to go up to accommodate the rising volume of transactions. With XRP at $1 you cannot move trillions, so the price will have to be higher.\n\n3) XRP is in a fairly unique situation, because it is used as a bridge currency/asset to settle transactions with other currencies/assets. This means that demand doesn\u2019t care what is the price of XRP. If you want to send money from Europe to the US, from EUR to USD, you don\u2019t care how much one XRP costs, you don\u2019t care if for bridging your transaction there was 10 XRP used or 1000 XRP.\n\nIn normal market conditions demand wants the price of an asset down, meanwhile offer wants it up. The market price is where demand and offer cross. But as I explained, utility demand for XRP won\u2019t care for the price, only for the spreads/liquidity. So, there is only offer that cares about the price and it wants it up. And technicalities, because as explained in 2), with increasing volume of transactions and decreasing supply of XRP, the price of XRP has to go up.\n\n--------------------\n\nNow, the question is, who will represent offer with XRP? Who are and will be market makers? Entities that will accumulate XRP. I think not only exchanges, but also banks, the same way they are market makers for you when you want to exchange fiats, but it is not that important at this time). \n\nYou want to do a transaction, they will sell you XRPs for your fiat and then buy the XRP back with another fiat to settle the transaction in the desired currency. The spread between their sale and buy prices will be their earnings (everything is of course done automatically and takes only seconds within xRapid).\n\nBut not only that. As they will be XRP holders, they will also be interested in driving the price up in every possible way. This way in the future they might sell some of their holdings for profits and with the increasing price still be able to answer the demand for XRP for the transaction bridging purpose. New market makers will enter the market, because they will want to make money through the market making process and possibly with holding as well.\n\nSo far the market has been dominated by speculation, this is why the price of XRP is doing such crazy waves. But I think that at this time it is clear that XRP has real utility that will increase demand for this asset. Being a market maker is and will be profitable, like with Forex. Fiat currencies are used to move value, so will be XRP.\n\nSo, there will be time when present crypto pump and dump whales will become irrelevant with XRP, when the big players will all want the price of XRP to go up and when the price will be way, way higher (forget about the market cap thing, XRP is not a stock, it is a vehicle that will move trillions, so it has to have an adequate value for this task).\n",

I'm one of the \"crypto\" guys in my community and have often been asked about Bitcoin - people have began asking me more about Ripple recently which is fascinating. Some of these traditional investors are very comfortable  and attracted to the idea of investing in XRP long term vs. Bitcoin. They really like that Ripple/XRP has a strong use case and potential to add major value to the financial system accompanied with the fact that it's being directed by super talented team of individuals. Nothing against Bitcoin at all but it's interesting to see Ripple start to click in peoples heads while they still struggle to understand the role Bitcoin plays in the future. ",

How does f.ex. a gold bar \"depend on USD for its value\" just because it is priced in USD?\n\nBitcoin is a new asset class, being both a commodity store of value and a currency. It's only natural that its relative worth be measured in USD until its no longer natural to value things in USD.\n\nI'm honestly trying to understand the point, or question, you keep repeating, but it just doesn't make much sense, I'm sorry."

        "post_title": "Clarification on Bittrex pre-fork process",
        "post_body": "Earlier today, a user received a support reply from Julian Yap at Bittrex, which you can see [here](https://redd.it/881par). We were a bit surprised at the response because most of it is false and misrepresents the actual preparation our team made ahead of the fork. Because of this, we felt the need to respond; before we wrote this response, we confirmed with Julian Yap that the support ticket reply was legitimate.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n1) We were informed by Julian Yap in January that Bitcoin forks were frowned upon and sent to the following [article](https://support.bittrex.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001919932-Policy-on-Claims-Stakes-Promotions-Giveaways-Forks-and-Airdrops). Regardless, we continued to develop and follow the policy Julian supplied to us.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n2) We applied to Bittrex formally on Jan 29, 2018 to support the Bitcoin Private hardfork and list Bitcoin Private. We received an email back from Julian Yap on Jan 31, 2018 outlining that Bittrex would review the coin and would not inform us if our coin was accepted or declined. We didn\u2019t hear back from anyone on the Bittrex team until two days before the snapshot (Feb. 26) where Julian Yap outlined his concerns with specific regard to \u201cindustry wide support.\u201d Bittrex then updated their fork policy (link above which also shows policy revision dates) to state this only after our conversation. Two days was simply not enough to address such a non-specific concern, particularly when our full focus at this point was the mainnet launch. It\u2019s important to note that when we approached various entities about fork support, we were often met with \u201cWhy isn\u2019t Bittrex supporting the fork?\u201d \n\n&nbsp;\n\n3) We had multiple testnets up prior to the fork which Bittrex was welcome to connect to. We gave them to our partners, such as Coinomi, weeks in advance of the fork. [Our first testnet was up on January 27th](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinPrivate/comments/7tgesb/bitcoin_private_fork_simulation_now_running/). [The second testnet was up on February 24th](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinPrivate/comments/801frv/testnet_mining_pool_list/). There were many connections to both testnets, including several mining pools. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n4) Our point of contact, Julian Yap, never mentioned SegWit support being a concern. To the extent of our knowledge, Bittrex does not support SegWit, so this is an odd concern for them to have. Furthermore, we have partial SegWit support (claiming is in testing now) and full SegWit support will be coming soon. We have full records of all correspondence with them and have confirmed they never mentioned this as a concern. If requested by Bittrex, we are more than willing to provide this evidence. As a part of our initial outreach to The Bittrex team in late January, we sent a detailed report outlining our mission, community support evidence, plans outlining that the open source community is taking this project seriously, etc. No questions were ever asked on any of this detailed material. Julian Yap\u2019s support reply implies that we were notified with \u201cother requirements\u201d by Bittrex weeks in advance, which is false.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTo reiterate, we felt a need to respond as many members of our community have responded to Julian\u2019s support reply and are rightfully asking for clarity surrounding this scenario. Furthermore, we will continue to respect Bittrex\u2019s right to whatever coins/tokens they wish to support.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWe are confident that with continued development of our technology, the imminent real world adoption of our user friendly merchant products, and dedication to creating an ecosystem that helps bring private transactions to a mainstream audience that our community and industry wide support will continue to grow.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFor continued progress and outlining of our various strategies, [please check out our Medium account](https://medium.com/@bitcoinprivate).",

A big fault and I must have been so much more careful. It was early morning which I had just woke up, etc.. I must have been so much more careful as that is almost $200,000 worth of EOS tokens which is so big for me and for almost anyone. Idiot me, exactly.\n\nI was always very very careful during transfers.. but not this time. Just one time and it is gone.\n\nI have entered comments in the EtherScan's related transaction and account pages.\n\nI have also now contacted the 3 exchanges (Binance, Bittre and Bitfinex) which I can trace that the \"owner of the wrongly sent user\" has accounts on them and look forward to their help that they can contact the user.\n\nLessons learned:\n- never do transfers when you are sleepy\n- never copy-paste other accounts while you are about to transfer tokens to not get confused\n- check the address you are about to send multiple times\n- and check it more....\n\nI'm just hoping that the user does the right thing and resends the tokens back to the originating address (which is 0x452ADbf99EabE15fE73Be7b5184CD2195af1E0d4).

This is not a zero-sum game; there's room for multiple blockchains in this insane, growing crypto world. The two ecosystems can learn from one another's mistakes and challenges. Using interoperability platforms like Cosmos, the two could even connect and interact with one another in ways we can't foresee.\n\nWe're all in this together. We're looking to build a better world using the power of distributed computing. I suspect most of our core values are in alignment. So let's stop being so damn tribal about it. The world is big enough for multiple smart contract platforms. Our *real* rivals are the centralized power structures that perpetuate rent-seeking behaviors and other dynamics that make the world a shittier place to live in.\n\nThat said, I see two big potential challenges with EOS:\n\n- The SEC could classify EOS as a security, making its stateside adoption much more difficult.\n\n- The EOS ecosystem needs to gain a critical mass of developer mindshare. This, in my mind, is one of the greatest strengths of Ethereum. At ETHDENVER in February, we hosted the largest-ever blockchain hackathon with over 1000 super geeked-out and enthusiastic participants. This is part of what makes it so much fun to be involved in Ethereum, and having more minds working on DApps and scaling initiatives is super-beneficial. Can EOS foster and grow its own vibrant dev community? If so, I think its odds of success are much greater.\n\nWhen you boil it down, most crypto tribalism stems from economic incentives; owning certain tokens creates a natural and deep-seated bias. But strip that away, and you're left with a lot of promising crypto projects that have thoughtful leaders and cool communities. They stand to make the world a better and freer place. So best of luck with that - and let's not fall into the one-dimension tribal thinking that will prevent blockchain technology from realizing its full potential. ",

        "body": "Thank you!\n\nThe SEC implied in its Munchee ICO ruling that it's skeptical of the \"utility token\" argument. That's the position being taken by just any digital asset these days that raised money in an ICO. The head of the SEC has also stated that he has yet to see an ICO that *wasn't* a security. And they're investigating dozens of projects.\n\nETH could fall into that category as well. On the other hand, the fact that it's more well established and already has a huge, well-diversified ecosystem means that perhaps it's less likely to fit the \"depends on efforts of others\" aspect of the Howey test that the SEC uses to determine whether an asset is a security. (For more color on this, check out this recent interview with Peter Van Valkenburgh of Coincenter: https://epicenter.tv/episode/227/).\n\nAnother interesting aspect is that in the DAO ruling last year, the SEC stated that ETH is a *currency*. Of course that's not a binding statement, and it's also highly contextual, but it does indicate that maybe they view ETH as more of a BTC-style cryptocurrency and not an ICO.\n\nSo much uncertainty right now. I hope regulators don't strangle all this innovation in the cradle."

        "post_title": "Clarification on Bittrex pre-fork process",
        "post_body": "Earlier today, a user received a support reply from Julian Yap at Bittrex, which you can see [here](https://redd.it/881par). We were a bit surprised at the response because most of it is false and misrepresents the actual preparation our team made ahead of the fork. Because of this, we felt the need to respond; before we wrote this response, we confirmed with Julian Yap that the support ticket reply was legitimate.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n1) We were informed by Julian Yap in January that Bitcoin forks were frowned upon and sent to the following [article](https://support.bittrex.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001919932-Policy-on-Claims-Stakes-Promotions-Giveaways-Forks-and-Airdrops). Regardless, we continued to develop and follow the policy Julian supplied to us.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n2) We applied to Bittrex formally on Jan 29, 2018 to support the Bitcoin Private hardfork and list Bitcoin Private. We received an email back from Julian Yap on Jan 31, 2018 outlining that Bittrex would review the coin and would not inform us if our coin was accepted or declined. We didn\u2019t hear back from anyone on the Bittrex team until two days before the snapshot (Feb. 26) where Julian Yap outlined his concerns with specific regard to \u201cindustry wide support.\u201d Bittrex then updated their fork policy (link above which also shows policy revision dates) to state this only after our conversation. Two days was simply not enough to address such a non-specific concern, particularly when our full focus at this point was the mainnet launch. It\u2019s important to note that when we approached various entities about fork support, we were often met with \u201cWhy isn\u2019t Bittrex supporting the fork?\u201d \n\n&nbsp;\n\n3) We had multiple testnets up prior to the fork which Bittrex was welcome to connect to. We gave them to our partners, such as Coinomi, weeks in advance of the fork. [Our first testnet was up on January 27th](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinPrivate/comments/7tgesb/bitcoin_private_fork_simulation_now_running/). [The second testnet was up on February 24th](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinPrivate/comments/801frv/testnet_mining_pool_list/). There were many connections to both testnets, including several mining pools. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n4) Our point of contact, Julian Yap, never mentioned SegWit support being a concern. To the extent of our knowledge, Bittrex does not support SegWit, so this is an odd concern for them to have. Furthermore, we have partial SegWit support (claiming is in testing now) and full SegWit support will be coming soon. We have full records of all correspondence with them and have confirmed they never mentioned this as a concern. If requested by Bittrex, we are more than willing to provide this evidence. As a part of our initial outreach to The Bittrex team in late January, we sent a detailed report outlining our mission, community support evidence, plans outlining that the open source community is taking this project seriously, etc. No questions were ever asked on any of this detailed material. Julian Yap\u2019s support reply implies that we were notified with \u201cother requirements\u201d by Bittrex weeks in advance, which is false.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTo reiterate, we felt a need to respond as many members of our community have responded to Julian\u2019s support reply and are rightfully asking for clarity surrounding this scenario. Furthermore, we will continue to respect Bittrex\u2019s right to whatever coins/tokens they wish to support.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWe are confident that with continued development of our technology, the imminent real world adoption of our user friendly merchant products, and dedication to creating an ecosystem that helps bring private transactions to a mainstream audience that our community and industry wide support will continue to grow.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFor continued progress and outlining of our various strategies, [please check out our Medium account](https://medium.com/@bitcoinprivate).",

In section 2, you use the term 'outlined his concerns'.\n\nOn either of these occasions or any others, was it indicated to the dev team that the issues they were raising would most likely be a barrier to acceptance on the exchange?\n\n* 2. In section 2, when you say 'would not inform us if our coin was accepted or declined', do you mean at that specific time, or that it is their policy to never reveal this information to devs until an official announcment is made?\n\nTo me, the strangest thing about all the revelations yesterday, is that Mr Yap seemed to decide to release this information to the community via a casual email response to a member of the general public, while everyone else has been waiting patiently for an official announcement from the devs or directly from Bittrex.\n\nTo me personally, it seems to be unproffesional to make such an important announcement in this way and I think the devs got the tone of their response right as they had to give their side of the story, especially if they've made every effort to follow the correct procedures along the way.\n\nAt the same time, Mr Yap's email leaves me with a nagging feeling that what the devs refer to as 'concerns' are what Bittrex may have felt they'd made clear were likely barriers to acceptance. It leaves me wondering whether Mr Yap believed he'd indicated the most likely decision to the devs a long time ago and that it had therefore already been made common knowledge by now?"

The disbelief is astounding, your mind just cannot make sense of the empty space in front of you so it starts rationalising, leading you to believe you must have parked elsewhere. So you end up walking around the car park for a while until eventually reality dawns that the vehicle is in fact no longer on the premises and you start feeling that sickly empty pit in your stomach.\n \nThat is pretty much the same nausea that you feel when you realize that the coin you believed held such great promise may in fact turn out to be the shitcoin all the \"fudsters\" were talking about. Admission of an error in judgement is a hell of a thing, none of us like admitting we were wrong.\n\nI mined the donation pool from day 3 to help the devs build a decent war chest to ensure the coin had the best chance of success. Couldn't sell at ATH because I had nothing to sell till after the fork. Once I had something to sell the price had fallen to breakeven of mining expenses so I held.\n\nInteresting thing of BTCP price action:\n- When the market goes down BTCP goes down\n- When the market goes sideways BTCP goes down\n- When the market goes up BTCP goes down\n\nPretty consistent performance across all market conditions.\n\nWeak hands do not apply to me, I cannot sell at current price so might as well put my coins in the bottom drawer and look at them again in a few years.\n\nI am not salty in the very least, best lessons are always painful and wherever I go from here I will always remember the reaming I received from BTCP. \n\nThe popping of my crypto cherry, screwed without even getting dinner or a glass of wine let alone the application of lube or the courtesy of a reach around.\n\nBag Hodlers we shall be, for thee oh BTCP for thee !",

        "subreddit": "Electroneum",
        "post_title": "Electroneum Blockchain Upgrade FAQ",
        "post_body": "  \n\n**FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS**\n\n**ELECTRONEUM\u2019S MODERATED BLOCKCHAIN**\n\n**Q: What is a Moderated Blockchain?** \n\n**A:** Electroneum\u2019s new Moderated Blockchain (a type of permissioned blockchain that is at the qualitative level of IBM\u2019s Hyperledger or Facebook\u2019s announced Libra open ledger network) that has been uniquely and cleverly developed to provide Electroneum with a minimal but sufficient level of interference. This will allow the highly skilled engineering staff to supervise the distributed ledger which is maintained by a list of trusted validators. And this allows the tech team to detect anomalies or irregularities that could come from hackers attempting to breach our security, and immediately stop them preventing a double-spend or 51% attack. Because Electroneum controls the list of trusted validators, this empowers them to guarantee, and that is similar to IBM\u2019s hyper ledger or that of Facebook\u2019s Libra blockchain.\n\n**Q: Why did you move to a Moderated Blockchain?**\n\n**A:** To improve the functionality of Electroneum at the exchanges, allowing them to confirm deposit transactions faster and to protect the network from 51% attacks, and also Electroneum can decide to where the block rewards are rerouted ensuring that they are used to help improve the lives of the poorer in underdeveloped countries.\n\n**Q: What is the role of blockchain in a permissioned network?**\n\n**A:** It is essentially an immutable history of financial transactions. Electroneum\u2019s Moderated Blockchain, which is a type of permissioned blockchain, unlike other decentralised cryptocurrency networks, can guarantee a tamper-proof system of transactional records. \n\n**Q: What motivation would someone have to trade on a permissioned blockchain when their transaction could get rolled back, or worse still, never get confirmed?**\n\n**A:** With Electroneum\u2019s new Moderated Blockchain reorganisations can still occur but never will an irregular transaction actually be fully confirmed and then overwritten. \n\n**Q: Is there any risk of manipulation with a moderated blockchain?**\n\n**A:** There is a risk of manipulation if an authenticator key is leaked. However, the extent would be negligible and therefore not affect users, exchanges or miners. We developed a system to closely monitor the behaviour of both the network and miners to ensure any foul play is immediately crushed.\n\n**Q: How is Electroneum\u2019s Moderated Blockchain different to other decentralised blockchains?**\n\n**A:** We have the authority to decide who mines the blocks and therefore, we can increase the likelihood that they are trusted validators.\n\n**Q: Why doesn\u2019t Electroneum move to a fully centralised blockchain?**\n\n**A:** Our unique and cleverly created Moderated Blockchain is meant to have minimal interference to remove the risks and add protection whilst remaining decentralised to the point wherein the unlikely event that a meteor was to wipe out all of the Electroneum staff out of the face of the Earth by a meteor, ETN would not cease to exist. This because those nodes currently mining our blockchain or anybody else for that fact could swap out the codes and fork the network to take over control and guarantee the permanence of the cryptocurrency thus shielding our users from losses.\n\n**Q: What is Proof of Responsibility or PoR?**\n\n**A:** Proof of Responsibility, or PoR for short, is a new mining paradigm which obligates the miners to two primary responsibilities which are: 1) Maintain the integrity of the payment network, and 2) Spend the block rewards they receive responsibly to help poor people in line with Electroneum\u2019s humanitarian agenda.\n\n**Q: How does PoR compare to PoW or Proof of Work?**\n\n**A:** PoR saves a lot of time and energy compared to PoW because instead of working with block validators overtime to prove or not that they\u2019re reliable miners, we save time and potential adverse issues by hand-picking the miners ourselves. \n\n**SECURITY AND 51% ATTACKS OR DOUBLE SPENDS**\n\n**Q: What is a 51% attack?**\n\n**A:** It is when someone takes over 50% control of the hashing power of a cryptocurrency. Hackers usually use this to benefit themselves with double spends, which is a hard loss for the exchanges as well as users in many cases.\n\n**Q: What IS an example of a 51% attack?** \n\n**A:** You may know 51% attacks better from both Bitcoin Cash in 2018 and Ethereum Classic in 2019, where hackers acquired more than 50 percent of the hashing power on those networks and getting away with a significant loot.\n\n**Q: What is hashing power?**\n\n**A:** This is the rate with which the mining rigs solve mathematical problems.\n\n**Q: Why doesn\u2019t Electroneum require large amounts of hashing power anymore?** \n\n**A:** The Electroneum network difficulty automatically adjusts to maintain the target block time of two minutes. Regardless of the magnitude of the hashing power in Electroneum\u2019s network will be kept to a two-minute target block time.\n\n**Q: Is Electroneum now insusceptible to a 51% attack?**\n\n**A:** We\u2019re no longer susceptible to a 51% attack \u2013 making us one of the most secure blockchains in existence today. \n\n**Q: What if someone hack one authenticated miner?**\n\n**A:** In the unlikely event that hackers were to succeed in breaching the security of an authenticated miner, the authentication key of that miner would not be accessible to the hacker in itself because of the unique way our blockchain team has come up to shield it from being discovered. The hacker, therefore, would not be able to affect the network because they would be unable to mine sequential blocks. And because of the uniqueness of the Moderated Blockchain, our moderating network layer would immediately detect the breach and rescind the rights of that miner. \n\n**Q: What if two or more hacks?**\n\n**A:** If one hack is highly unlikely due to two security breaches being necessary, two hacks are exponentially harder to achieve. But if it were to happen, the keys they may have stolen limit the hash rate of the miner. This means that if somebody were to take the code and run it on the highest-powered mining machine, it would still produce the same hash rate as it would in the lowest powered mining rig making it impossible for them to control over 50% of the network\u2019s hash rate because of the way our Moderated Blockchain is set up. This also ensures the NGOs can run an Electroneum mining node on hardware with which their tech teams are familiar.\n\n**Q: How do you judge how responsible the miners are?**\n\n**A:** We look at how many blocks they are mining compared to how many blocks they are expected to mine going by the hashing power allotted to them.\n\n**Q: What happens after a mining node has been shut off?**\n\n**A:** Simply, it stops mining and needs to be restarted and then retype or re-enter the authentication key.\n\n**NEW TRUSTED MINERS**\n\n**Q: Who are the miners?**\n\n**A:** We have chosen vocational NGOs as trusted mining partners who are also trustworthy organisations. We have done due diligence to ensure they are transparent, honest, and aligned with our vision to work within the developing world. We have made sure that they also want to accompany us in our goal to expand our Gig Fair project, which is aimed at helping provide people in the poorest regions of the world with an income opportunity and the opportunity to attain skills and means to generate an income that will empower them to live better. The NGOs that we\u2019ve selected are trusted brands that have proven track records in helping people. Cryptocurrency is at its early stages and is met with skepticism by many people and entities around the world as well as in the developing world. So, our mission is to educate these NGOs about cryptocurrency so that they can, in turn, convey the message of the benefits of crypto, particularly ETN, to people in the developing world and make them feel more confident to use crypto, which ultimately will help spur crypto\u2019s mass adoption.\n\n**Q: Why are these NGOs anonymous (initially)?**\n\n**A:** Because they themselves have decided to remain anonymous over concerns of how cryptocurrency could reflect on their organisations.\n\n**Q: What do NGOs do for the project?**\n\n**A:** They validate the blocks and rewarded for this and take the proceeds to help people?\n\n**Q: Where are the NGO\u2019s and Charities located?**\n\n**A:** For now, locations of the NGOs are being kept undisclosed for security reasons until they themselves decide they if they want to make public that information.\n\n**Q: Five million ETN or about $22,500 at the then valuation was paid out daily before. How much is being paid out now?**\n\n**A:** Because the block rewards have been reduced by a whopping 75% creating scarcity which is a good thing to extend longevity, currently just over 1.2 million ETN or about $5,300 is being paid out in block rewards.\n\n**Q: Can we see who is mining and how much they are mining?**\n\n**A:** The block rewards will still be visible on the blockchain explorer and those with sufficient technical knowledge will be able to see the different miners signing blocks with different mining keys. But Electroneum is not forcing the NGOs to reveal their identities because they are still going through a learning curve and when they understand crypto and experience the benefits first-hand, they will more than likely reveal themselves.\n\n**Q: Where are their mining rigs stored?**\n\n**A:** We have suggested that mining rigs be run in the cloud to ensure uptime; however, ultimately, it is up to the NGOs themselves decide where their equipment is hosted. It is essential to point out that we have reduced energy and hash rates by a millionfold as such a standard rack-mounted server that you would find in any business today is sufficient to run an Electroneum mining node.\n\n**Q: Who setup their mining rigs?**\n\n**A:** At this stage, all mining rigs have been set up by the Electroneum team as this is the first foray for NGOs into the cryptocurrency mining space.\n\n**Q: Who is managing their mining rigs?**\n\n**A:** The mining rigs are self-sufficient and need very little if any, technical support, however, a moderator layer monitors the new Moderated Blockchain to ensure the mining rigs are online and benefit the network. If we were to detect a mining rig going offline, we would inform the NGO and provide assistance where required.\n\n**Q:** **How will NGOs use their ETN (from mining blocks)?**\n\n**A:** The NGOs, initially, almost certainly convert the ETN to USD or other currencies because they have always used fiat to deliver their donations and assistance because that is what they are used to doing. Once they see the benefits and value of ETN they may start using it on the ground to amongst the people they help. We have deliberately targeted NGOs that are in regions that were we are imminent to enable airtime top-ups directly with ETN from within the Electroneum mobile app.\n\n**FUTURE PROGRESS & CORPORATE PARTNERSHIPS**\n\n**Q: How will this initiative affect corporate partnerships moving forward?**\n\n**A:** Because the network is more secure, Electroneum as a platform will be more attractive as a platform in the eyes of potential partners.\n\n**Q: How will it help to grow our on-the-ground initiatives?**\n\n**A:** The NGO\u2019s we\u2019re working with will be in the regions we\u2019re targeting on the ground. So, this will be contributing to the eco-system, the NGO\u2019s will be able to spend their ETN on education through the Gig Economy too.\n\n**Q: Can new NGOs apply to mine?**\n\n**A:** I If you know or are an NGO that focuses on vocational training and education, and that it is within the developing world, then we would love to hear from you via our community forum.\n\n**Q: How will the 75% reduction in the block reward benefit the community?**\n\n**A:** Reducing the block rewards means ETN \u2018s expands the longevity of the coin by making ETN scarcer and thus lengthening the duration of the emission of coins.",

Let's take an extreme example where 2 million tokens were moved to Pool 1, and 1 token was moved to pools 2-15. 2 million tokens get to split the fees from pool 1 while pools 2-15 get outsized rewards. We are literally staking like a 1950s game show of, \"what is behind door number 3?\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe other question I have are if these pools are even active. I know it is a beta and this is still early into the v3 transition but most of the pools (in the current epoch) look nonexistant. I can set up my own pool and be pool 16 but it doesn't mean I'll actually do anything on it and then I have people staking on my pool that doesn't do anything because there is no visibility into what is going on. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn a positive note the guide was straight forward and I would ignore most of the onboarding questions from people who weren't paying attention to the v3 transition and only looking at this subreddit or Twitter because of the hype.

        "post_title": "How Electroneum handled issues after forking to V6?",
        "post_body": "Hello everyone,\n\nIn this post I will be covering how we handled the issues we had after forking to V6, listing down the real issues despite the FUD ones. I wanted to write this post earlier but we were so busy analyzing and discussing how we would handle the issues from last few days that I couldn't fine a reasonable time window to write a complete post like this one.\n\n**Firstly, I would like to list all of our issues after forking to V6 as well as doing a brief commentary of each one.**\n\n**1)** **Difficulty was too high considering post\\-fork hash rate.**\n\n* Going straight to the point: yes, it was our fault. We didn't expected such sudden drop in the hash rate after forking (from 1.6GH/s to 2MH/s). To be honest we were predicting a hash rate of \\~200MH/s. However, we have acknowledged that our prediction doesn't make any sense at all! Why would we still have 200MH/s of CPU/GPU miners in such high difficulty set by ASICs? It simply doesn't make sense and now we understand that.\n\n**2)** **Mempool had some RingSize 5 transactions that were invalidating the block, thus not being able to mine any block at all.**\n\n* We missed the mempool handling of old transactions, meaning that we should have implemented a code to drop invalid transactions from the mempool according to the current network consensus (transaction max ringsize = 1). This was causing blocks containing these invalid transactions being rejected at node level and the network got stuck, not being able to output a single block.\n\n**How we handled these** **problems in the last few days:**\n\nWe didn't wanted to fork again in order to fix these issues. Forking means that all pools, exchanges and miners would need to update their software in a relatively short period of time, and usually an emergency fork is not something good either. Plus, forking would involve few more days of testing, releasing binaries and waiting for everyone to update.\n\nWith that in mind, this is how we decided to manage the issues:\n\n* **Issue #1:** we decided to rent some hashing power in NiceHash to speed up the difficulty adjustment process. However, since the network was stuck due to the issue #2, we had to start mining empty blocks because they would not get rejected as they are empty of transactions. Mining empty blocks gave some time to invalid ringsize 5 transactions in the mempool to expire so that we could start mine regular blocks again. We could have switched back to mine regular blocks after 3 days from the fork (transactions have 3 days life time in the mempool), but we didn't decided to do so. NanoPool was reporting that some blocks were still getting rejected on their end, so we decided to keep mining empty blocks to reduce the difficulty so that, with the block time reduced to a few minutes, we would be able to better investigate the issue reported more efficiently. Plus, going back to mine regular blocks would mean that some blocks could be still rejected (according to NanoPool), thus drastically increasing the time needed to reach block 307575 in which the difficulty level would be adjusted. In addition, if we decided to mine regular blocks at that time and a block gets rejected, we would have spent way more with NiceHash than we currently did in order to reduce the difficulty level, since rejected blocks are not considered by the difficulty adjustment algorithm.\n* **Issue #2:** for the invalid transactions in the mempool, we have simply waited for them to expire. However, in parallel, we implemented the proper mempool handling of invalid transactions so it gets flushed automatically. This patch would be released soon and it wont require a fork since it is a minor update. We had the chance to apply this patch to our own daemon when the mempool had invalid transaction in order to fully test this change, it and went fine!\n\nToday we reached block 307575 and the difficulty level have dropped significantly as we predicted. With the difficulty level adjusted within GPU rig ranges, several pools other than Nano (which was mining empty blocks) could successfully mine regular blocks (with transactions included). Meaning that the block rejection issue reported by NanoPool was just \"bad luck\" from their side. It's worth mention that we didn't release or send any additional patches to the pools. They are actually running our ETN V2.0.0 original code and being able to mine regular blocks!\n\nIt is worth mentioning that a few blocks are still empty because NanoPool haven't reverted their code to original ETN V2.0.0. They are running a specific code to mine empty blocks and it should be reverted to normal soon. We may see some more empty blocks until they do this revert. Fairhash also has a specific code regarding mempool treatment in which they are only keeping 5 TXs in it for logging and debugging purposes. They should revert the code to original ETN v2.0.0 and start mining regular blocks soon.\n\n**Couple interesting points I noticed today:**\n\n1. One of the blocks that were mined earlier today had a total of 222 transactions in it, meaning that we could support \\~2 transactions per second. That is not bad at all compared to other blockchain technologies. Still, we're looking forward to increase our transaction throughput even more in the future!\n2. Electroneum is currently the most profitable CryptoNight coin to mine!\n\nI would like to thank everyone who contributed supporting us during this tough period.\n\nSome of you even suggested possible fixes on GitHub!\n\nRegards,\n\nAndre Patta",

Fortunately, they were ready because they had been developing their product for years. \n\nThis is also true with artists that work hard for years then blow up the one time a record executive decides to listen.\n\nIt's completely possible that Stellar never blows up and just fades into obscurity because it takes a certain amount of luck to hit mainstream.

Firstly, that is the new API which is much more simple, easy to integrate, includes dynamic fees, and economical for us to maintain.\n\nAfter the hardfork is released (June 12th) the main goal is to move all of our new users to our new code base because once the new hardfork is released we will not longer maintain the old code and will move all of our focus and improvements to the new code, which is much more maintainable and user friendly.\n\nMoreover, we're introducing dynamic fees, which is actually the changing of the consensus. Some more minor updates will follow as well."

You can exchange fiat money and use stellar lumens as liquidity solution, you can make agreements and so much more, the outer space is the limit! Plus it is faster than most of the solutions out there, XRP is the only solution that can equal the speed of stellar, however at the moment stellar fee is cheaper than xrp \n\nThe Story: here is where Stellar shines, the project is nonprofit and the team behind it have a noble cause for creating the whole project, they aim to make the world a better place, provide easy solutions for poor people and poor countries where transferring money is difficult and expensive, people in general like the heroic stories, and Stellar shine in this subject as they aren\u2019t after making money or greed \n\nThe scalability: Stellar platform can host so many different tokens and currencies and other types of projects and solutions, to put it on perspective, it is like the Android platform, it is a great platform however it only shines if it was adopted by programmers and mobile companies, stellar is the same, the platform is great however it can shine only if people and companies adopted it and used it for their currencies ICO\u2019s and different tech solutions, \n\nFor all of those reasons I believe Stellar can really become something so huge, even bigger than Bitcoin and the rest of the market but it needs more adoptions, I believe the marketing team of stellar will have a huge challenge in front of them to promote the project but if they do it right all of the lumens holders will be happy they did chose stellar \n\nNote: I have invested in both XRP and Stellar and I believe on both projects for different reasons, both can coexist in my opinion and succeed on their different path..",

Isn't it strange how most of the coins pumping are all \"cheap\" as in they are less than $10 per coin? Isn\u2019t it strange how the crypto market cap grew by $58 billion today, but Bitcoin\u2019s market cap did not change at all? Then I had a realization. What if everyone is being played by a greater power.  If you don\u2019t like conspiracy theories stop reading now.\n\nEveryone has been justifying the altcoin surges as Bitcoin taking a rest and dumb money chasing \u201ccheap coins\u201d, but what if it is actually institutional investors using alt coins in order to accumulate Bitcoin. It makes a lot of sense. If you look at the dates the surges started \n\n* XRP - December 8\n* XLM - November 27\n* IOTA - November  6\n* ADA - November 27\n* XEM - December 8\n\nThe futures trading press release went out on December 1, but what if some people knew that it would be approved ahead of time? If you are an investor with deep pockets you have a problem. You want to be able to bet on Bitcoin\u2019s future price, but you don\u2019t own enough Bitcoin to be able to manipulate the market (it is much easier to gamble when you control the outcome). You need a way to accumulate.  Articles start to hit the press about how a small group of whales control a huge amount of the supply of Bitcoin and that makes it dangerous, etc. Big players are trying to convince people that Bitcoin is not a safe investment. Lots of bubble talk spreads. Jim Cramer says you are better off going to Vegas than buying Bitcoin.  It doesn\u2018t scare the public away.\n\nThese investors are usually the ones who get first stab at new assets. They get to invest early in companies, they get first stab at IPO shares when a company goes public, but with Bitcoin they are late to the party. How are they going to accumulate? They aren\u2019t stupid. They realize that driving the price of Bitcoin down too much to buy cheaper will scare people away from the market, and there is a limited amount of downside (it can only go as low as $0), but there is an infinite amount of upside. They also don\u2019t own enough Bitcoin to crash the market that far.  So what do they do?\n\nThe answer is: find alt coins that are \u201ccheap\u201d. They know that if someone has to choose between a $15,000 dollar coin and a $1 coin they will choose the $1 coin every time. It is a psychological thing. Everyone just looks at the price and believes that $1 coin can also go to $15,000 one day.  So if institutional money starts to buy up huge amounts of these \u201ccheap coins\u201d and gets the general public on board, they can then accumulate huge amounts of Bitcoin without the Bitcoin price changing at all because alt coins trade against Bitcoin! If you want to quadruple the amount of Bitcoin you have, it is much easier to pump up a smaller coin and sell it, than it is to drive down the Bitcoin price 4x to accumulate more for the same amount of USD.\n\nTake a look at some of the headlines lately. I suspect the press releases are also coordinated:\n\n* RIPPLE to become the new BITCOIN? Surge in new cryptocurrency as banks FAVOUR it \n* Bitcoin latest: Ripple\u2019s XRP is best-performing cryptocurrency with 380-fold increase in 2017 \n* Bitcoin price WARNING: The cryptocurrency will burn out in SPECTACULAR CRASH\n* Bitcoin is Akin to Gambling, Causing Egypt to Ban It\n\nIn addition to these alt coin surges, every time Bitcoin looks like it is going to break out a new sell wall appears and some market selling into the buys begins to drive the price back down. To me this is a very well executed effort to hold down Bitcoin\u2019s price while accumulating more by pumping alts. I noticed earlier today a $1 million buy wall on XLM that was moving up as the price increased. Is that how a normal person would buy up XLM? It is possible, but I doubt it.\n\nI know it seems wild, but if this theory is correct then it means at some point there will be a pretty fantastic dump with alt coins and a giant surge for Bitcoin.\n\nOf course, I could also just be thinking crazy thoughts.\n\nAlso on steemit: https://steemit.com/bitcoin/@ccampbell/bitcoin-manipulation-theory",

I expected a few minutes at least but I clicked withdrawl and by the time I click my Kraken browser and hit refresh my funds had moved for a fee of a whopping $0.00\n\nI usually rip on the blind faith following that XRP has but now I understand why it has it.

Feature-wise, the main functions that have been added are snapshot transitioning and securing the two factor authentication key locally by porting it to keychain. Some of the performance improvements are still in the pipeline, but avoiding unnecessary UI re-rendering and optimised versions of some UI components have been implemented. \n\nSome important design and integration decisions have been made related to shifting core logic to a separate module. Some of the varied internal implementations, e.g. address generation on initial load, have been ported to the external module. Still some of the core features e.g promotion/reattachment will need to be shifted/generalised. Currently, the external module is undergoing testing, and the remaining Trinity feature set will move to the external module once testing is complete.\n\nOn the Desktop side the progress has been quite fast. We are now nearing the point of Alpha testing (Again more info will come and we'll make sure you don't miss it). The majority of the UI elements are completed. The main tasks left are implementing a number of small features to mirror those in the Mobile wallet and refactoring the codebase for maintainability. \n\nDocumentation and code styled guides are almost done, which will mean we'll be able to have community contributions when public and help those auditing understand design choices and application structure.",

        "post_body": "We\u2019re all bored until the next wave up, so let me explain why the price will go up big time. The only condition is xRapid being adopted, which clearly is happening, so the price will go up. Here is why (I am not a native speaker, so exuse me if my formulations are not very smooth).\n\n1) There is a limited number of XRPs and this number is going down (a tiny fraction of XRP being burned with every transaction). \n\n2) With an increasing volume of transactions and the amount of XRP going down, the value of XRP has to go up to accommodate the rising volume of transactions. With XRP at $1 you cannot move trillions, so the price will have to be higher.\n\n3) XRP is in a fairly unique situation, because it is used as a bridge currency/asset to settle transactions with other currencies/assets. This means that demand doesn\u2019t care what is the price of XRP. If you want to send money from Europe to the US, from EUR to USD, you don\u2019t care how much one XRP costs, you don\u2019t care if for bridging your transaction there was 10 XRP used or 1000 XRP.\n\nIn normal market conditions demand wants the price of an asset down, meanwhile offer wants it up. The market price is where demand and offer cross. But as I explained, utility demand for XRP won\u2019t care for the price, only for the spreads/liquidity. So, there is only offer that cares about the price and it wants it up. And technicalities, because as explained in 2), with increasing volume of transactions and decreasing supply of XRP, the price of XRP has to go up.\n\n--------------------\n\nNow, the question is, who will represent offer with XRP? Who are and will be market makers? Entities that will accumulate XRP. I think not only exchanges, but also banks, the same way they are market makers for you when you want to exchange fiats, but it is not that important at this time). \n\nYou want to do a transaction, they will sell you XRPs for your fiat and then buy the XRP back with another fiat to settle the transaction in the desired currency. The spread between their sale and buy prices will be their earnings (everything is of course done automatically and takes only seconds within xRapid).\n\nBut not only that. As they will be XRP holders, they will also be interested in driving the price up in every possible way. This way in the future they might sell some of their holdings for profits and with the increasing price still be able to answer the demand for XRP for the transaction bridging purpose. New market makers will enter the market, because they will want to make money through the market making process and possibly with holding as well.\n\nSo far the market has been dominated by speculation, this is why the price of XRP is doing such crazy waves. But I think that at this time it is clear that XRP has real utility that will increase demand for this asset. Being a market maker is and will be profitable, like with Forex. Fiat currencies are used to move value, so will be XRP.\n\nSo, there will be time when present crypto pump and dump whales will become irrelevant with XRP, when the big players will all want the price of XRP to go up and when the price will be way, way higher (forget about the market cap thing, XRP is not a stock, it is a vehicle that will move trillions, so it has to have an adequate value for this task).\n",

My point about it being made up was more about \"deflation is more dangerous than inflation\". I do agree that rapid change in a currency is going to mess with a market, especially where you have sticky prices and fixed contracts (due to the prior expectations of a stable currency) but this is irrelevant to whether it's inflation or deflation. There are far more examples of runaway inflation causing issues than the other way around.\n\nAny argument that can be thought of against deflation on the technical/nuts-and-bolts level can be applied to inflation equally (and often times is more applicable to inflation) just by flipping the question."

You've got to VPN, and those get smoked constantly.. and put you at risk.\n\nLittle Justin has a solution. I underestimated him. This is a global play by Jack Ma and Justin Sun to decentralize content in China. \n\nThink about it.. the BFC is a NAS.. so what.. oh wait, what if.. we put VIDEO into the blockchain. Then.. you put the blockchain validator on the NAS.. where does the video live?? Yep.. its now a little CDN node. So you can watch the content by paying tron tokens to view blockchain content, but you can also SERVE that blockchain content to OTHER people.\n\nSo.. China hasn't figured this out. But I have. Justin and Jack just changed censorship in China, and there will be no way PRC can stop them. Before, you pull off content by ordering the provider to turn off their network access.. Now, you have 511,000 individual nodes.. try to take THAT offline.\n\nClever Chinese man.. they always find a way. That's why China is keeping it down, they are loading up before this is understood. They really did do something, and you guys are worried about ICO whitepapers.. lol.. get on a plane and investigate the WORLD if you want to make sense of any of this.\n\nRespect little jbizzle.",

        "post_title": "Tron and BitTorrent (My Thoughts)",
        "post_body": "Hi all, I wanted to share my personal opinion on the Tronix and BitTorrent acquisition due to some of the comments I've seen floating around. I don't have any insider knowledge into the project, and most of what I talk about is speculative, but I think it might help provide some context to those who are not too familiar with this space. \n\n\nFirstly, the comment I see most often is regarding pirated content. While torrents are widely used for illegal content, it's also used by open source companies to distribute large files and reduce their operational expenses. Yes, there may be illegal content on torrent networks, but this has nothing to do with Tron or their plan to integrate. It may be possible that it's used for something illegal, the legal aspect will likely far outweigh the illegal and it will be akin to the internet with good and bad and memes. Except this would be a distributed internet where you cannot block the memes. \n\n\nIf you currently use torrents, you should take a long think about what is going on. You are using a decentralized peer to peer technology to move files between potentially millions of users around the world. This is content that you are not supposed to have in many cases, yet you are allowed to download it because of decentralization, regardless of where you live. So, even though Tron's integration with BitTorrent will likely not have anything to do with pirated material, the main takeaway from the current system is that torrents have been around for over a decade and no government has been able to shut them down successfully, this plays a huge part in a uncensored web.  There are already millions of users by the Tron owned companies at this point, who are used to running torrent client all day every day, now they can get paid with a software update and opting in.  The barrier to entry is vastly reduced now, as this all becomes very familiar to everyone involved. \n\n\nNow to why this really matters.\n\nBitcoin was revolutionary and allowed peer to peer payments, bypassing the current banking system.  Ethereum was revolutionary for allowing the blockchain to become a stateful computer, allow immutable trust in code alone and not some fatcat at a centralized company. The issue with Ethereum is bulk data storage, which is expensive as fuck (over $1,000 per GB), so while you can arbitrarily update contract variables like names and addresses, storing bulk data is problematic. \n\nWith Tronix incorporating torrents into their platform, this allows for the storage of bulk data at a very low cost, most likely beating commercial storage providers. This opens up so many new worlds that it's hard to fathom. Let me present a few random potential uses:\n\n#1: Smart Contract Storage\n\nSmart contracts currently need to rely on an external source for much of its data, called an Oracle. This means that transactions are very costly, and centralized. Once you are able to store bulk data on the chain, processing that data may become rather cheap due to computational power being cheap on nodes while storage is not. \n\nImagine there is a smart contract that is a decentralized eBay like auction site. You can sell items, and the ether can be held in escrow until items arrive. These already exist. Now, say you wanted to upload a photo for the item, you are now having to use imgur.com or other means as you cannot upload directly to the blockchain. Now, you can, and it will likely cost you and/or the auction platform some minimal fees to put into the seeders pool. \n\nImagine the VM becomes powerful enough to perform intense computational calculations on large datasets, think Map Reduce. This isn't a current usage pattern, most people would go to amazon... But imagine if you could process a large amount of data via distributed compute and storage? \n\nImagine if you were a smart contract developer, and you could store or retrieve any arbitrary data from the torrent network? Not only could you store data, but you could encrypt it, and provide various means of access, whether free (big projects may not need incentive for people to seed) or incentivized. \n\n\n#2: Original Content\n\nUsers will be able to create their own content, whether a picture, movie, music, program, etc. Currently, you have a few choices, but mostly you put out your own website/store and hope that profits outweigh hosting costs, or you use a platform such as ITunes or ThemeForest, or ShutterStock which will take 50% of your profits but you dont have to worry. \n\nNow, artists would be able to upload their content to the decentralized platform, offering incentives for hosting the content to average day Joe's. These incentives would come from the buyer in most cases like this, where a portion of the TRX goes to the seeders, and most of it to the creator.  There will probably be numerous decentralized stores/distributors that you can join to make the process seamless. \n\n\n#3: User Payments\n\nWhile the lines are blurry, you can imagine a model like Brave browser, which allows users to integrate digital currency into their browsing habits. Think of being able to opt-out of advertisements on YouTube by being able to pay a small fee for no ads. You can donate to your favorite bloggers, etc. You can purchase digital goods directly from the creator. You may even be able to get benefits such as 'no ads' or 'no paywall' without paying, but instead by being a seeder of that company/blogger/studios content.\n\nImagine there is a very important set of files that you needed to host. You have the following requirements:\n\n* The files should be encrypted and accessible only by me. \n* The files should be distributed to many sites around the world to ensure they are always available.\n* The files should be accessible to me at any time, from anywhere. \n* The cost of storage should be more than free, but not excessive. \n* A tamper-proof audit log should be available for each time you (or anyone) access the files.\n\nIn this situation, for lets say a family photo album, or scans of important documents. You could pay some rather small amount to ensure your data is distributed. I don't know the economics of this, but I imagine it would be the more you paid, the higher the availability would be and the longer it would be stored for. \n\n\n\nIn the end of the day, just think of this: \n\n**BTC** Decentralized Currency\n\n**ETH** Decentralized Currency + World Computer\n\n**TRX** Decentralized Currency + World Computer + World Filesystem\n\n\nWarning, this was all pulled out of my ass but makes sense if you look at the roadmap and understand both blockchain and torrents. Don't confine yourself to think only what you know or currently use, once money hits an ecosystem, all of the fancy interfaces come out, etc. \n\n\nI am pretty excited for what lies ahead!\n",

        "post_body": "It\u2019s the 5th week since the experiment has started and a lot has been happening, I actually wonder to know if during the 5 years of the experiment there is going to be a quiet week.\nThe crypto world has been bombarded by FUD, first with China banning the miners, then with South Korean ban on the exchanges, all this caused the price of Bitcoin (BTC) to go as low as $13,105.90 USD. As if it wasn\u2019t enough, Warren Buffet said that \u201cBitcoin and Cryptocurrencies will come to a bad end\u201d. All these caused also the altcoins price to go on a rollercoaster, but today seems like most of them are bouncing back.\nTo go into details about the experiment, the overall gain is $2533 USD (253%) or 0.19 BTC.\nOnly 10 Cryptocurrencies are in minus since the beginning of the experiment and 3 of them have reached a gain of over 1000 %.\nLet\u2019s talk about our Top5 cryptocurrencies.\nTron (TRX) is also for this week the best gainer. Five weeks ago I bought 2500 TRX with $10.04.  2500 TRX are worth now $275.48, a gain of 2644.83 %\nJustin Sun, founder of Tron. Announced this week a new cooperation with Bao Feng, and been teasing about a cooperation with an innovative space company.\nVerge (XVG) finally released to so waited Wraith protocol. The price has been stable and 1 XVG is now worth $0.15 , I first bought it 5 weeks ago at $0.0079.\nVechain (VEN) is the first new entry on the Top5,  looking at the chart it has been rising for over one month. In fact, when I bought it 5 weeks ago, I got with $10.11 , 18 (VEN), at the time the price was of $ 0.56 , right now the price is $6.24, so the 18 VEN is now worth $112.48 a major gain of 1012.14 %.\nThe other new entry on the Top5, sitting at the 4th position is Binance Coin (BNB), it\u2019s been a while since BNB has been performing well, not sure about the exact reason, but it could be connected by the fact that Binance volume keeps growing massively. BNB can be used as trading fee option on Binance, doing so it lowers the trading fees from 0.1 % to 0.05%.\nBinace volume has been that high that they could barely keep up and had to halt a few time the sign up of new users. From a recent tweet, they announced that they got over 5 Million users!\nRipple (XRP) is having again a big momentum, yesterday MoneyGram signed a deal with them announcing that it will use it to speed up their transitions. I believe this is one of the biggest wins for Ripple so far.\nTop 5 cryptocurrencies so far :\nTron (TRX)  +2644.83 % , from $10.04 to $275.48\nVerge (XVG)  +1794.52 % , from $9.62 to $182.25\nVeChain (VEN) +1012.14 % , from 10.11  to $112.48\nBinance Coin (BNB) +914.17 % , from $9.99 to $99.48\nRipple (XRP)  +837.01 % , from $9.75 to $91.34\n\nArticle : https://buyandhold100crypto.com/week-5-2533-usd-gained/",

        "post_body": "**Welcome to the official IOTA subreddit.** \n\nIf you are new you can find lots of information here, in the sidebar and please use the search button to see if your questions have been asked before. Please focus discussion on IOTA technology, ecosystem announcements, project development, apps, etc. Please direct help questions to /r/IOTASupport, and price discussions and market talk to /r/IOTAmarkets.\n\nBefore getting started it is recommended to read the [IOTA_Whitepaper.pdf](https://iota.org/IOTA_Whitepaper.pdf). I also suggest watching these videos first to gain a better understanding.\n\n[IOTA BREAKDOWN: The Tangle Vs. Blockchain Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_jNH9BlEEo)\n\n[IOTA tutorial 1: What is IOTA and some terminology explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsaPA3U4ung)\n\n***\n#Information\n\n###Firstly, what is IOTA?\n>IOTA is an open-source distributed ledger protocol launched in 2015 that goes 'beyond blockchain' through its core invention of the blockless \u2018Tangle\u2019. The IOTA Tangle is a quantum-resistant Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), whose digital currency 'iota' has a fixed money supply with zero inflationary cost.\n\n>IOTA uniquely offers zero-fee transactions & no fixed limit on how many transactions can be confirmed per second. Scaling limitations have been removed, since throughput grows in conjunction with activity; the more activity, the more transactions can be processed & the faster the network. Further, unlike blockchain architecture, IOTA has no separation between users and validators (miners / stakers); rather, validation is an intrinsic property of using the ledger, thus avoiding centralization.\n\n>IOTA is focused on being useful for the emerging machine-to-machine (m2m) economy of the Internet-of-Things (IoT), data integrity, micro-/nano- payments, and other applications where a scalable decentralized system is warranted.\n\nMore information can be found [here](https://iota.readme.io/docs/what-is-iota).\n\n###Seeds\nA seed is a unique identifier that can be described as a combined username and password that grants you access to your IOTA.\n\nYour seed is used to generate the addresses and private keys you will use to store and send IOTA, so this should be kept private and not shared with anyone. If anyone obtains your seed, they can generate the private keys associated with your addresses and access your IOTA.\n\n###Non reusable addresses\nContrary to traditional blockchain based systems such as Bitcoin, where your wallet addresses can be reused, IOTA's addresses should only be used once (for outgoing transfers). That means there is no limit to the number of transactions an address can receive, but as soon as you've used funds from that address to make a transaction, this address should not be used anymore.\n\n**Why?**\n\nWhen an address is used to make an outgoing transaction, a random 50% of the private key of that particular address is revealed in the transaction signature, which effectively reduces the security of the key. A typical IOTA private key of 81-trits has 27^81 possible combinations ( 8.7 x 10^115 ) but after a single use, this number drops to around 27^54 ( 2 x 10^77 ), which coincidentally is close to the number of combinations of a 256-bit Bitcoin private key. Hence, after a single use an IOTA private key has about the same level of security as that of Bitcoin and is basically impractical to brute-force using modern technology. However, after a second use, another random 50% of the private key is revealed and the number of combinations that an attacker has to guess decreases very sharply to approximately 1.5^54 (~3 billion) which makes brute-forcing trivial even with an average computer.\n\nNote: your seed is never revealed at at time; only private keys specific to each address.\n\n**The current light wallet prevents address reuse automatically for you by doing 2 things:**\n\n1. Whenever you make an outgoing transaction from an address that does not consume its entire balance (e.g. address holds 10 Mi but you send only 5 Mi), the wallet automatically creates a new address and sends the change (5 Mi) to the new address.\n\n2. The wallet prevents you from performing a second outgoing transaction using the same address (it will display a \u201cPrivate key reuse detected!\u201d error).\n\nThis piggy bank diagram can help visualize non reusable addresses. [imgur link](https://i.imgur.com/3oejD6v.jpg)\n\n[Insert new Safe analogy].\n\n###Address Index\nWhen a new address is generated it is calculated from the combination of a seed + Address Index, where the Address Index can be any positive Integer (including \"0\"). The wallet usually starts from Address Index 0, but it will skip any Address Index where it sees that the corresponding address has already been attached to the tangle.\n\n###Private Keys\nPrivate keys are derived from a seeds key index. From that private key you then generate an address. The key index starting at 0, can be incremented to get a new private key, and thus address.\n\n**It is important to keep in mind that all security-sensitive functions are implemented client side.** What this means is that you can generate private keys and addresses securely in the browser, or on an offline computer. All libraries provide this functionality.\n\nIOTA uses winternitz one-time signatures, as such you should ensure that you know which private key (and which address) has already been used in order to not reuse it. **Subsequently reusing private keys can lead to the loss of funds (an attacker is able to forge the signature after continuous reuse).**\n\nExchanges are advised to store seeds, not private keys.\n\n***\n\n#FAQ\n\n##Buying IOTA\n\n###How do I to buy IOTA?\nCurrently not all exchanges support IOTA and those that do may not support the option to buy with fiat currencies.\n\nVisit this website for a Guide: [How to buy IOTA](https://howtobuyiota.co.uk/)\n\nor [Click Here for a detailed guide made by /u/450LbsGorilla](https://www.reddit.com/r/Iota/comments/7jbohf/i_was_tired_of_seeing_people_ask_this_question/)\n\n###Cheapest way to buy IOTA?\nYou can track the current cheapest way to buy IOTA at [IOTA Prices](https://iotaprices.com/).\n\nIt tells you where & how to get the most IOTA for your money right now. There's an overview of the exchanges available to you and a buying guide to help you along.\n\nIOTAPrices.com monitors all major fiat exchanges for their BTC & ETH rates and combines them with current IOTA rates from IOTA exchanges for easy comparison. Rates are taken directly from each exchange's official websocket. For fiat exchanges or exchanges that don't offer websockets, rates are refreshed every 60 seconds.\n\n###What is MIOTA?\nMIOTA is a unit of IOTA, 1 Mega IOTA or 1 Mi. It is equivalent to 1,000,000 IOTA and is the unit which is currently exchanged.\n\nWe can use the metric prefixes when describing IOTA e.g 2,500,000,000 i is equivalent to 2.5 Gi.\n\nNote: some exchanges will display IOTA when they mean MIOTA.\n###Can I mine IOTA?\nNo you can not mine IOTA, all the supply of IOTA exist now and no more can be made. \n\nIf you want to send IOTA, your 'fee' is you have to verify 2 other transactions, thereby acting like a miner/node.\n\n***\n##Storing IOTA\n\n###Where should I store IOTA?\nIt is not recommended to store large amounts of IOTA on the exchange as you will not have access to the private keys of the addresses generated.\n\n####Wallets\n\n**GUI Desktop (Full Node + Light Node)**\n\n>Version = 2.5.6\n\n>Download: [GUI v2.5.6](https://github.com/iotaledger/wallet/releases/tag/v2.5.6)\n\n>Guide: [Download/Login Guide](https://matthewwinstonjohnson.gitbooks.io/iota-guide-and-faq/getting-started/dl-wallet.html)\n\n>Nodes: [Status](https://iota.dance/nodes)\n\n**Headless IRI (Full Node)**\n\n>Version = 1.4.1.4\n\n>Download: [Mainnet v1.4.1.4](https://github.com/iotaledger/iri/releases/tag/v1.4.1.4)\n\n>Guide:\n\n>Find Neighbours: /r/nodesharing\n\n**UCL Desktop/Android/iOS (Light Node)**\n\n>Version = Private Alpha Testing\n\n>Website: [iota-ucl (Medium)](https://medium.com/iota-ucl)\n\n**Android (Light Node)**\n\n> Version = Beta\n\n> Download: [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.iota.wallet)\n\n**iOS (Light Node)**\n\n> Version = Beta Testing\n\n> Website: [https://iota.tools/wallet](https://iota.tools/wallet) \n\n\n**Paper Wallet**\n\n> Version = v1.3.6\n\n> Repo: [GitHub](https://github.com/arancauchi/IOTA-Paper-Wallet)\n\n**Seed Vault**\n\n> Version = v1.0.2\n\n> Repo: [GitHub7](https://github.com/jonassix/IotaSeedVault/)\n\n\n###What is a seed?\nA seed is a unique identifier that can be described as a combined username and password that grants you access to your wallet.\n\nYour seed is used to generate the addresses linked to your account and so this should be kept private and not shared with anyone. If anyone obtains your seed, they can login and access your IOTA.\n\n###How do I generate a seed?\nYou must generate a random 81 character seed using only A-Z and the number 9.\n\nIt is recommended to use offline methods to generate a seed, and not recommended to use any non community verified techniques. To generate a seed you could:\n\n####On a Linux Terminal\n use the following command:\n\n        cat /dev/urandom |tr -dc A-Z9|head -c${1:-81}\n\n####On a Mac Terminal\n use the following command:\n\n        cat /dev/urandom |LC_ALL=C tr -dc 'A-Z9' | fold -w 81 | head -n 1\n\n####With KeePass on PC\nA helpful guide for generating a secure seed on KeePass can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1b4dpnC6VWTQ3N7JHVU3SwYmwL_dt-QRD/view).\n\n####With a dice\n[Dice roll template](https://www.reddit.com/r/Iota/comments/7hos4t/secure_dice_roll_seed_generator_template/)\n\n###Is my seed secure?\n 1. All seeds should be 81 characters in random order composed of A-Z and 9.\n 2. Do not give your seed to anyone, and don\u2019t keep it saved in a plain text document. \n 3. Don\u2019t input your seed into any websites that you don\u2019t trust.\n\n[Is Someone Going To Guess My IOTA Seed?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8YIdmwcubc)\n\nWhat are the odds of someone guessing your seed?\n\n * IOTA seed = 81 characters long, and you can use A-Z, 9\n * Giving 27^81 = 8.7x10^115 possible combinations for IOTA seeds\n * Now let's say you have a \"super computer\" letting you generate and read every address associated with 1 trillion different seeds per second.\n * 8.7x10^115 seeds / 1x10^12 generated per second = 8.7x10^103 seconds = 2.8x10^96 years to process all IOTA seeds.\n\n###Why does balance appear to be 0 after a snapshot?\nWhen a snapshot happens, all transactions are being deleted from the Tangle, leaving only the record of how many IOTA are owned by each address. However, the next time the wallet scans the Tangle to look for used addresses, the transactions will be gone because of the snapshot and the wallet will not know anymore that an address belongs to it. This is the reason for the need to regenerate addresses, so that the wallet can check the balance of each address. The more transactions were made before a snapshot, the further away the balance moves from address index 0 and the more addresses have to be (re-) generated after the snapshot.\n\n###What happens if you reuse an address?\nIt is important to understand that only outgoing transactions reveal the private key and incoming transactions do not. If you somehow manage to receive iotas using an address after having used it previously to send iotas\u2014let's say your friend sends iotas to an old address of yours\u2014these iotas may be at risk.\n\nRecall that after a single use an iota address still has the equivalent of 256-bit security (like Bitcoin) so technically, the iotas will still be safe if you do not try to send them out. However, you would want to move these iotas out eventually and the moment you try to send them out, your private key will be revealed a second time and it now becomes feasible for an attacker to brute-force the private key. If someone is monitoring your address and spots a second use, they can easily crack the key and then use it to make a second transaction that will compete with yours. It then becomes a race to see whose transaction gets confirmed first.\n\nNote: The current wallet prevents you from reusing an address to make a second transaction so any iotas you receive with a 'used' address will be stuck. This is a feature of wallet and has nothing to do with the fundamental workings of IOTA.\n\n***\n##Sending IOTA\n\n###What does attach to the tangle mean?\nThe process of making an transaction can be divided into two main steps:\n\n1. The local signing of a transaction, for which your seed is required.\n2. Taking the prepared transaction data, choosing two transactions from the tangle and doing the POW. This step is also called \u201cattaching\u201d.\n\nThe following analogy makes it easier to understand:\n> \n> Step one is like writing a letter. You take a piece of paper, write some information on it, sign it at the bottom with your signature to authenticate that it was indeed you who wrote it, put it in an envelope and then write the recipient's address on it. \n> \n> Step two: In order to attach our \u201cletter\u201d (transaction), we go to the tangle, pick randomly two of the newest \u201cletters\u201d and tie a connection between our \u201cletter\u201d and each of the \u201cletters\u201d we choose to reference. \n\nThe \u201cAttach address\u201d function in the wallet is actually doing nothing else than making an 0 value transaction to the address that is being attached.\n\n###Why is my transaction pending?\nIOTA's current Tangle implementation (IOTA is in constant development, so this may change in the future) has a confirmation rate that is ~66% at first attempt.\n\nSo, if a transaction does not confirm within 1 hour, it is necessary to \"reattach\" (also known as \"replay\") the transaction one time. Doing so one time increases probability of confirmation from ~66% to ~89%.\n\nRepeating the process a second time increases the probability from ~89% to ~99.9%.\n\n### How do I reattach a transaction.\nReattaching a transaction is different depending on where you send your transaction from. To reattach using the GUI Desktop wallet follow these steps:\n\n1. Click 'History'.\n2. Click 'Show Bundle' on the 'pending' transaction.\n3. Click 'Reattach'.\n4. Click 'Rebroadcast'. (optional, usually not required)\n5. Wait 1 Hour.\n6. If still 'pending', repeat steps 1-5 once more.\n\n###Does the private key get revealed each time you reattach a transaction?\nWhen you use the reattach function in the desktop wallet, a new transaction will be created but it will have the same signature as the original transaction and hence, your private key will not revealed a second time.\n\n###What happens to pending transactions after a snapshot?\n\n***\n##IOTA Network and Nodes\n\n###What incentives are there for running a full node?\nIOTA is made for m2m economy, once wide spread adoption by businesses and the IOT, there will be a lot of investment by these businesses to support the IOTA network. In the meantime if you would like to help the network and speed up p2p transactions at your own cost, you can support the IOTA network by setting up a Full Node.\n\n**Running a full node also means you don't have to trust a 3rd party light node provider.**  By running a full node you get to take advantage of new features that might not be installed on 3rd party nodes.\n\n###How to set up a full node?\nTo set up a full node you will need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Download the full node software: either GUI, or headless CLI for lower system requirements and better performance.\n2. Get a static IP for your node.\n3. Join the network by adding 7-9 neighbours.\n4. Keep your full node up and running as much as possible.\n\nA detailed user guide on how to set up a VTS IOTA Full Node from scratch can be found [here](https://forum.helloiota.com/2424/Setting-up-a-VPS-IOTA-Full-Node-from-scratch).\n\n###How do I get a static IP?\nTo learn how to setup a hostname (~static IP) so you can use the newest IOTA versions that have no automated peer discovery please follow this [guide](http://www.iotasupport.com/staticip.shtml).\n###How do I find a neighbour?\nAre you a single IOTA full node looking for a partner? You can look for partners in these place:\n\n* [Subreddit: NodeSharing](https://www.reddit.com/r/nodesharing/)\n* #nodesharing channel on the official IOTA slack\n* [HelloIOTA Forum](https://forum.helloiota.com/Community/Node-Sharing)\n\n***\n\n##Resources\nYou can find a wiki I have been making [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IOTASupport/wiki/).\n\nMore to come...\n\n**If you have any contributions or spot a mistake or clarification, please PM me or leave a comment.**",

They arrogantly expect the world to come to them without any real efforts at marketing or even basic community building/outreach.  Naively, they believed technology alone was sufficient to secure their place in a market that thrives on pump and hype.  Unforutnately, I think they have burned up a lot of good will that they had and will now launch Catapult into what is essentially a void.  I really hope I'm wrong about that and people start giving NEM the credit they deserve but they have managed to really isolate themselves somehow from the larger crypto world."

It's an unique thing and details are not available. \n\n- smart contracts are in development. ETA is this year. It will be done not like eth smart contracts, but done in functional programming paradigm/style.\n\n- Max Minchenkov said that IOTA are doing a solution together with CISCO for an undisclosed oil company, where IOTA will provide software and CISCO hardware. No ETAs or any other info. \n\n- Ternary hardware is still in development. It will be ternary CPU and Li-Fi. No ETAs or any other info. \n\n- Cfb is more on hardware part now, other team members do work on IRI. \n\nI can verify that people do build their own stuff on IOTA, personally saw a few teams today that build something on IOTA. And real word development on IOTA do happens outside of \"crypto community\". So the fact that it's quite in bitcointalk or even media means nothing. Work do progressing behind the doors. \n\nI talked personally with Cfb. He is a very polite and intellegent person.

        "post_body": "Because I see a lot of new altcoin enthusiasts joining /r/altcoin, I made a simple glossary with crypto jargon. Do you miss anything? Don't hesitate to add it as a comment (I will edit the post).\n\n---\n\n**Altcoin**, the abbreviation for alternative coin, or alternate coin, or all blockchain projects and related currency that exist in addition to Bitcoin.\n\n**Bearish**, a downward trend.\n\n**Block** is a part of the Blockchain and is usually associated with an encrypted hash with the previous block in the block.\n\n**Blockchain**, very neatly explained by [Nieuwsuur](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARwzaQV7AwU) (or [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD9KAnkZUjU)), but in text: a decentralized database that maintains a data list that can not be manipulated.\n\n**BTC (\u0e3f)**. I do not intend to spell out all currencies, but Bitcoin is an exception.\n\n**Bullish**, an upward trend.\n\n**Core wallet**, a wallet that contains the whole blockchain and most of the time delivers tools to give developers the ability to program in or on the blockchain.\n\n**Circulation supply**, number of coins that are actually circulating.\n\n**Dapps** *aka* applications written in the blockchain, which means it's a *d*ecentralized *app*lication *aka* Dapp.\n\n**Electrum wallet**, a light weight wallet to store coins. Doesn\u2019t download the blockchain, but gets the information from a third party.\n\n**Encryption**, data lock that can only be unlocked with a private key.\n\n**Exchange**, sometimes called coinexchange, is the exchange office where buyers and sellers can trade in Bit and Altcoins. Examples are Litebit, BTCdirect, Kraken and Bittrex.\n\n**Fiat** money is a currency without intrinsic value established as money by government regulation or law. Think of $, \u00a3, \u00a5 or \u20ac.\n\n**FOMO** means Fear Of Missing Out. As the term suggests, the Bitcoin or an altcoin rises sharply in value and investors take steps without rationale \u2013 so emotion \u2013 because they are afraid to miss the boat.\n\n**FUD** stands for Fear, Uncertainty & Doubt. In the world of crypto FUD means spreading fear, uncertainty or doubt about a certain blockchain project.\n\n**Hash**, an encryption that can no longer be undone.\n\n**[HODL](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=375643.0)**, either hold, but then written wrong. Reportedly a Bitcointalk user wearing a drunk mood over his keyboard. HODL is currently jargon for long-term investor cryptocurrency trader. Nice acronym mentioned in the comments: Hold On Despite Loss.\n\n**[ICO](https://newkidsontheblockchain.nl/en/2017/06/whats-an-ico-and-how-to-participate/)**, Initial Coin Offering. A crowd sale that offers the opportunity to purchase digital coins from a new blockchain project.\n\n**Market cap**: price per coin *x* circulating supply.\n\n**Max Supply**, maximum amount of coins that will ever exist in currency lifetime.\n\n**Miner**, device validating the blockchain (transactions).\n\n**Mining reward**, the reward that a miner receives for the computing power he delivers to check the nodes in the blockchain.\n\n**Mnemonic Phrase** a fancy version of your private key, that is actually used to derive multiple private keys.\n\n**Public key**, publicly accessible \u201ckey\u201d, in crypto currency jargon your wallet.\n\n**Private key**, the key to open your wallet.\n\n**Proof of Stake**, verification of the blockchain is done by (wallet) adresses with a certain amount of coins. The more coins means the more authority and computing power for verifying the blockchain.\n\n**[Proof of Work](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Proof_of_work)** is roughly a method where blockchain(transactions) are verified with computing power. \n\n**Satoshi** is the smallest part of a bitcoin. 1 Satoshi = 0.00000001 \u0e3f.\n\n**[Smart contract](https://newkidsontheblockchain.nl/en/2017/10/what-is-a-smart-contract/)** See a smart contract as a set of rules that can no longer be modified because it is stored in the blockchain. A smart contract will be executed if the circumstances comply to the set of rules.\n\n**[Wallet](https://newkidsontheblockchain.nl/en/2017/04/which-wallet-should-i-choose/)**, a digital wallet on cryptocurrency. Examples are [Jaxx](http://www.jaxx.io), [Exodus](https://www.exodus.io/) and the [Gulden Wallet](https://gulden.com/).\n\n---\n\n*Disclaimer: Originally posted [here](https://newkidsontheblockchain.nl/en/glossary-bitcoin-blockchain-cryptocurrency/).

Please be patient.\n\n**\"I Got 99 Errors and I'm Tired of This Shit\"** :  \nYou can send your ETH directly to the crowdsale address [here](https://etherscan.io/address/zrxsale.eth). DOUBLE CHECK THAT THE CONTRACT IS THE RIGHT ONE BEFORE SENDING, ALWAYS. \n\n**\"Can I send more than 1 transaction?\"**:  \nYes, as long as the sum of all your contribution is below the daily limit.\n\n**\"Metamask is unresponsive of always give me errors\"**  \nIt seems like Metamask can't handle the current load and transaction that failed might be blocking subsequent transactions to be sent (nonce related problem). The best solution is to use another wallet. Here's the simplest way via MEW:   \n\n* 1. Open Metamask  \n* 2. Click on the triple dots   \n* 3. Click on export privatekey  \n* 4. Copy private key  \n* 5. Open www.myetherwallet.com  \n* 6. Click on **Send ETH & Tokens**  \n* 7. Click on import Private key  \n* 8. Paste your private key (DO NOT PASTE IT ANYWHERE ELSE AND CLEAR YOUR CLIPBOARD AFTER)  \n* 9. Unlock wallet (might ask for password)  \n* 10. Specify the address to be zrxsale.eth  \n* 11.

        "post_body": "Crypto is risky right? In recent months we\u2019ve seen a real upsurge in scams and rug-pulls- which does nothing for those new to the space or anyone who\u2019s been robbed.\n\nCreating a safer environment through innovative and positive project development is critical for all.\n\nImagine you are a developer deeply invested in an ecosystem. Trying to create pioneering projects that innovate and open up defi for new users as well as those who have been in the space for a while. You\u2019ve been around a time, you\u2019re respected.\n\nNow imagine too, that all your genuine, hard work is often overshadowed by fly-by-night, unscrupulous folks who care little for the environment and what it could be and simply want to make personal gain at the expense \u2013 not only of investors \u2013 but the ecosystem they use to defraud them\u2026.\n\nIn a sea of sh*t and meme coins that threaten investors with rug pulls and scams, there are only a few (it seems) genuine projects trying to make a positive difference, both for investors but more importantly, for the ecosystem itself.\n\nFor every genuine project there are 10 with nefarious motives, threatening rugs or scams to defraud their investors \u2013 us, regardless of whether or not we are seasoned defi users. More than that though - it risks the integrity of the space in which it occurs and that is a black mark on the ecosystem, that has a fundamentally negative (and cumulatively so) effect on the likes of BSC or any blockchain. This is the opposite of what we want.\n\nAs the speed and accessibility of defi improves, opening it up to more users, so too will the scope for scammers increase. Indeed, since BSC is much cheaper than Ethereum, scammers have migrated over and there is a real need for safe projects. Safe not just in name but in deliverables too - to ensure the ecosystems in which they are built are trusted in the long term - otherwise there is the risk of the perceived integrity of those spaces being eroded.\n\nI\u2019m relatively new to crypto but this has become apparent very quickly and I have been extremely cautious in my approach (slow and steady) and I\u2019m involved with a few projects with noble goals (by no means an assurance) - projects like SAFERmoon who aim to improve the space for all and are - to all intents and purposes - building positively. By allowing new projects (even those with no coding experience but a gem of an idea) to build their token on blocks of pre-audited and safe code, their tokens can be launched with greater trust \u2013 which benefits both the new project, investors and the ecosystem itself. But while noble is great, there has to be a benefit for us as investors and that comes from Utility. There are a raft of meme type coins - so investors who want to be a little safer, should definitely focus on utility. Hype can be infectious - but it can also be expensive if the potential scam is realised - tokens offering utility are more likely to be serious about the long term.\n\nWhile SAFERmoon are promising their new project generator (it\u2019s apparently almost finished) SAFERmoon have also been delivering for their holders. Repeatedly. Beyond reflections they have also offered 3 rounds of staking with other well respected BSC projects Blizzard Money and JetSwap Finance.\n\nSAFERmoon is currently the only RFI token to allow fee-free staking (no 10% cost to stake and unstake as is the case with all other RFI tokens) while still receiving reflection rewards on transactions of the native token. In fact, they achieved that within 3 weeks of their inception. SAFERmoon holders have been making money during the current bearish run, while holders of other tokens give their investors the ability to buy branded sweatshirts and offer promises to lean on.\n\nUltimately new investors in meme-type coins are generally dragged along in marketing and swept-up in promises. My advice is to take a step back and look for utility and genuine goals - this is a pretty standard piece of advice for big crypto but seems to be overlooked or plain ignored in the altcoin arena - certainly lower down the list. There are great projects out there, you just need to be objective and the gems will present themselves. \n\nIf it\u2019s JUST hype / promises, be wary!\n\nhttps://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/safermoon/",

Which of the coins mentioned above is most likely to succeed? I know who I would put my money on (in fact I have).\n\nThe main issue we have at the moment is that XRP is heavily tied to BTC and until we break away as a stand alone currency we will sadly have to endure this sort of volatility. That said we are definitely heading in the right direction for example the SBI announcement earlier in the week which I am pretty certain is the first of many. \n\nYes it is sad to see your portfolio shrink especially if you are not a day trader.

This only needs to be done once.**\n\nOn or around June 1, 2018 **all EOS Tokens will become frozen and non-transferable** on the Ethereum blockchain. Not long after, I suspect that EOS community members will create a snapshot of token balances that carry over onto a new community generated and selected EOS blockchain. block.one will not be launching EOS blockchains or operating any of their nodes.

NEO is just 40x in advance against Ethereum, when I see neotracker.io for example, the system of Gas or ICOs that will be in the next months?\nEthereum has unfortunately became a garbage of useless ICO and scammers.\n\n\n*\n\n**Edit:** Due to number of comments I have to explain a little more my decision. By meaning garbage of useless ICO, I mean that only 1% of ERC20-based are real projects. If you are old in this game, just remember the GNO disaster, just look at the [richest token page](https://etherscan.io/tokenrichlist), who can prove that a manipulation is not possible? Why GNO team has more than $1,5B of their token? I mean it's like 95%. They can withdraw them on 200 days. And the market cap will be $1,5B? No of all. GNO will crash instantly, ETH and others will follow. People (and me) have used ICO too much and the system is done. Just look at District0x or BlockCat, and their cap in comparison with June with Status or Bancor (btw, I think I will never understand why a team will $150M to build a website or a single iphone app, but pass). \n\nAnother example, [EOS and their fucking infinity ICO](https://eosscan.io/), why the fuck do you explain that they have right now 1,1M ETH (and it's still running), why don't you think that they can cash out all of them one day? (because they do it each day) They don't even have a fucking product. It's just advertising, now you have put 1% of total ETH on greedy hands. I am sorry but I will never feel more as confiant as at the beginning on the Ethereum system.\n\nSo, okay, Ethereum has EEA and many future, but I feel more confiant about NEO's future with China and regulation, than all of this world of scammers/stealers on the Ethereum blockchain (that don't mean that NEO is safe, but for now, it is). \n\n\n**That's not the technology behind Ethereum that I critic, but the use that have been made during the past year. I explain my worry about what some greedy team behind huge ICO can do with *our* ETH.**\n\nNEO has still a lot to prove for all of us, and this is a **real working product**. \n\n*\n\nI was a proud hodler of Ethereum since feb 2016, now I have converted all of them and I have to say that I am full-NEO.

        "post_title": "Has anyone gained BTT from BitTorrent Speed and BTFS?",
        "post_body": "I have read multiple articles, posts and read the FAQ of BitTorrent and here is my conclusion:\n\n1) You only earn BTT on BitTorrent Speed if you seed popular videos and people that have BTT are willing to pay you to download quicker. Therefore, to make a decent amount of money, you need to download the top 10 most popular videos of the day and hope people pay you. Therefore, it is possible that you seed TB of data and that you made nothing.\n\n2) When downloading new torrents, you constantly need to check if you are using your BTT to speed up the download. By default it is on, but I have noticed that it sometimes resets based on random factors. Hence, each time you download new things, you need to refresh your dashboard and uncheck the toggle that increases your download speed. This will be the MAIN reason you lose your BTT.\n\n3) VPNs are great for this service for privacy reasons, but it also drastically limits you. I have noticed that when I turn on my VPN (I have Nord VPN), my upload and download speeds go down (as expected) and the connected BTT users gets cut in half or more. Less connected users means less BTT earned. My solution is to download cloudflare ([https://1.1.1.1/](https://1.1.1.1/)) and turn it on. It basically changes your DNS settings and keeps everything encrypted but it does not change your lP address and therefore, your speeds remain high. Your ISP won't see what you are doing with your bandwidth so you won't have any unexpected letters from your service provider!\n\n4) BitTorrent customer service is unreliable and you are basically on your own. There's a reason why the currency is below a penny!\n\n5) The dashboard is broken and it takes time for your BTT to show up. How long does it take? According to the FAQs, 24h, but many posts suggest that it can take a few days. No proper documentation on this, but it is what I noticed. Everything is not up to date. The only thing that is in real time is the amount of BTT users and your total amount seeded.\n\n6) BTFS requires a lot of time for new users to be validated. I have put 150 GBs up for storage, but only 0.006 GBs are being used. Also, I have a rating of 8/10. Apparently prizes are given each month to all users with a score of 5.5 and higher (might be wrong on the number).\n\n7) Should you just buy BTT instead? I am not a financial advisor, but here is my 2 cents on the matter: if your product does not work (broken dashboard, people keep loosing BTT because of a glitch), regular people can't contribute to the service and can't make coins, customer service is non-existent, then this project will royally fail. Crypto markets are going up, but many coins die out. If this coin does not change, it will drop back to 0. \n\n8) Have I made BTT since I started? Yes actually! 107 coins. However it appeared after the first 10 GBs of seeded content. I am currently at 6 TB of seeded content, but my balance has not changed. I have downloaded a bunch of different torrents and I currently have an average of 50 connected BTT users.\n\nHope this post helped! Let me know about your experiences with the platform.",

And that is what exactly happened today. All of my IOTA was stolen because of this exploit.\n\nIf you used MS Powershell to generate your seed, please, please change it right away. I do not want anyone else to suffer the way I did. \n\nHere is the link to the address where my IOTA was transferred:\nhttp://www.iota.tips/search/?kind=address&hash=TGJFAX9GFIUYF9GYLAOICEBRFGSBESGHHQTNN9KMBWYBPKCJODGFUEUCUWZHTYBQCAUEIHEOHCLJCSXTB \n\nIf you look at the other transactions to that address, they were done in very closely spaced time gaps.

        "post_body": "So, long story short, I started trading a year ago, been margin longing the whole run from 1k to 19k ( sometimes closing the top, sometimes closing too early or too late, but always making profit)\n\nI turned 3 lowly btc which I had from playing poker (at the time 3k) into nearly 200 BTC which was almost 4 million at the top and would be 2 million at current prices. \n\nI thought I was a trading genius, a god, whatever. Anyway, this is where the sadness starts.\n\nAfter the dump from 19k to 11k I went long at the bottom, and kept adding to my position on the bounce to 12k 13k, 14k. Then, at the 16k dead cat, my position was a further 100 BTC in profit. Instead of closing then and having a total 300 BTC, I increased leverage and increased my position size. This entire position was liquadated on the drop back to 12k, because my entry had moved up so much. I lost 100 btc paper profit and nearly 50 BTC margin. I was devasted, and down to 150 BTC total.\n\nAfter evaluating the situation, I came to the conclusion that the pump to 16k was a dead cat and that we are going lower. Therefore I shorted. At 12k. Added at 13k. Added at 14 and 15k. Got liquidated at the top at 17k. Another 50 BTC loss. Down to 100.\n\nThink, ok we made a higher high at 17k, uptrend back on. Went long. Got liquidated at 13k.\n\n50 BTC left. Devastated, unsure, no clue whats going on. Sat through the drop to 9k, when we bounced I thought it could be the bottom. Longed at 11500, panic closed 10500. When we went to 13k I was kicking myself for panic closing, went long at 12800.\n\nLiquidated this morning for my last bitcoin.\n\n3 BTC to 200, to 0\n\nAt this time I am still in shock, the last few months Ive neglected relationships and school, and Ive been daydreaming about living the high life rich as fuck with my millions.\n\nNow, I am nowhere.\n\nPosting this so others dont gamble away life changing money. Dont want donations or tips not posting an address dont PM me. I never want to hear the word btc again because I want to forget",

        "post_body": "Well, well guys, I happen to be A VICTIM of one of the hacked accounts (gq4demryhage) containing over 13,000 eos. The hacker moved the tokens twice - first to q4dfv32fxfkx and then to ktl2qk5h4bor (TWO NEWLY CREATED ACCOUNTS). In complaining to ECAF, the THREE accounts were frozen over just ONE incident. The evidence of this is on the blockchain for anyone to see. And even though, I don't have the tokens back, I am EXTREMELY GRATEFUL for the EOS Constitution that allows for an investigation and a recourse.  Personally, I am confident of being ultimately able to prove my case and I am certain the owner of the destination account (the other party) will get his chance to prove his position also. \nWhat if you were me and this was your life savings and there was no ECAF......!? What if?\n\nQuestion-1: how can you prove there was not a trade between the accounts      Ans 1: I think selling outside an exchange would mean the Buyer and Seller know each other and eventually Arbitration will get to the bottom of it\n\nQuestion-2:  Aren't cryptocurrency and blockchain supposed to be a trustless system    Ans 2:   I was willing to give up anonymity and 'trust' to ECAF because of what I stand to lose. It was MY CHOICE. \n\nNote that I had to give STRONG EVIDENCE of account ownership before I was considered. It could never be a freeze on an arbitrary account\n\n\n\n\nUPDATE 1\n\nFor the readers that are genuinely asking me to prove account ownership, here it is\n\nETH Address - 0x87A01e7257320B30D48e300c05B614d399fB973c \n\nEOS Address - EOS8FGCAJkt23EB6EnHrtrfSBca2LboLGyoiNvtUDvfkErJHnEvBp\n\nEOS Name - gq4demryhage\n\nSigned ETH Message \n\n{\n  \"address\": \"0x87a01e7257320b30d48e300c05b614d399fb973c\",\n  \"msg\": \"I am Argbw on Reddit!\",\n  \"sig\": \"0xf10aa90159f86c57861d7ee2112d690fcaaa603d9bff49709c090cee74254fa34e5bc1c832cf1266c53de163b4db51e3549b70e8201647b8e545a61a107d97d51b\",\n  \"version\": \"3\",\n  \"signer\": \"ledger\"\n}",

If you are invested in this coin, be invested in it.\n\nAlso, if you are invested in an asset that has a value based on psychological value, why would you be constantly posting and spreading fear?

Since I see many people being disappointed about the price action from after the xRapid announcement until now, asking what the difference now is if the volume doesn't increase from one day to another.  \n\n\nMy personal thoughts & perspective on it:\n\n1. The price more than doubled running up to Swell, outpacing any other cryptocurrency in September.\n2. xRapid is now in production, which does not mean that from one day to the other millions of cross-border transactions are being handled through the system. It. takes. time.\n3. The difference is, now it is a **fact** with testimonials from **actual customers**, that Ripple's product suite **is working and delivering great results**.\n4. Being invested in XRP is not anymore a matter of \"let's see what comes out in the end\", it officially turned into a matter of \"this is here to stay, to grow, to become bigger and bigger and bigger\".\n\nPersonally, I couldn't be more happy. I am not afraid of this investment being a high-risk investment anymore (by my own risk assessment, own research and those news coming out). I am more sure than ever that this will pay off and that Ripple is the right candidate to be a first mover towards the utilization of cryptocurrencies in the financial sector.\n\nAny other coin I am holding (yes, all of them) is still for me considered as a lost investment. XRP is not anymore.  \n**That is the difference.**",

        "post_title": "ICX from a Korean perspective",
        "post_body": "First things first, I am not Korean. I live and work in Seoul since years and got to know and love the country, the mentality and especially the people.\n\nSince I see that more and more people decide to invest in ICX, often driven by the promising outlook of a Korean team behind it, I decided it might be interesting and hopefully helpful to provide my view from a \u201cKorean\u201d perspective.\n\nSo first of all: if you bought ICX because of its Korean background and because you think it will drive its price \u2013 you were right. But I think there is a bit more to it than just the typical arguments mentioned here.\n\nAs we all know, Koreans are crazy about the whole crypto world. On my way to work I take the subway and I don\u2019t know how many people I see on their phone checking their portfolio and prices of cryptos. At my work no lunch break can go without at least two people talking about XRP, Litecoin, Ethereum but especially XRP. When XRP did its first major jump from around 0.26$ to 0.75$ one guy at work quit and is travelling the world right now. Koreans adopt everything new (especially when its technology) in a blink of an eye and their state is highly supportive when it comes to regulation, subsidies or such. \n\nPeople in this subreddit always make a point that once ICX will be traded on Korean exchanges (Coinone is part of the parent company of Icon, as you probably all know) the price will rise significantly. That\u2019s certainly true. Just like an introduction to any new exchange, especially when its offering a pairing with Fiat, pushes any coin, it will do the same for ICX. \nBy the way, Koreans do know about Binance and more people than you might suspect are already on it buying \u201ctheir blockchain\u201d, as my friends here call it.\n\nBut that\u2019s actually where it gets interesting: I think the main driver of any ICX price increase this year will be the patriotic (not say nationalistic) mindset of Korea. \nYou consider yourself patriotic? How about this: In the wake of the Asian financial crisis in 1998 the Korean government asked their people to donate money or gold to pay off the IMF`s debt ($58bn). Millions of Koreans donated their family gold, weddings rings etc., even causing the gold price world wide to drop. Korea paid off their debt way ahead of schedule and recovered from this crisis exceptionally well compared to other Asian countries. That\u2019s the kind of mindset here.\nSo, when I hear my colleagues talk about \u201ctheir blockchain\u201d I know ICX is backed by not just a great team and an actual product \u2013 it is backed by a country in which nearly every third working person is invested in cryptos. \n\nAnd last but not least, their team is outright ridiculous. Being brought up in the West, you might have never heard about Seoul University, Korea University or KAIST. I heard people comparing it to Harvard or MIT. I hope they understand that they are not the \u201clittle brother of Harvard/MIT\u201d they are equal substitutes. For a little more background: Koreans present the highest number of non-english-speaking students in the whole Ivy League. This country is completely over-educated (is that a word?). I work in a company providing supply-chain solution. Next to me sits Eunice. For her job she needs a profound understanding of Excel and a bit of logical thinking. She finished her Bachelor at Stanford which enabled her to do a PhD at Seoul university in Neuroscience. A PhD in goddamn Neuroscience\u2026 Her parents are still not happy tho haha. Anyways, hanging out with her friends from university makes me feel dumb and I have a doctoral degree as well\u2026 At least they tipped me about the  pre-sale of ICX \ud83d\ude0a\nSo when I saw what kind of guys are running this project, the insane funding they have and most importantly how much they all believe in it \u2013 I sold most of my stuff and got in.\n\nBut what I am trying to say is this: If you are in it for the short term \u2013 you will make a decent profit. \nBut you should be in it for the long-term. Forget about the mainnet-launch and about the upcoming listings on Korean exchanges. These guys actually have a product which is working, and they are backed by basically whole Korea (not the north tho). My friends are pretty much all-in on this and there are 56 million more interested.\n\n\nI hope this provided a little insight from a \u201cKorean\u201d perspective and was ultimately helpful to you\ud83d\ude0a\nI am looking forward to hearing your feedback and make sure you visit Seoul one day, it is wonderful!\n",

        "post_body": "$upBNB is the first BSC token in the upOnly ecosystem, from the developers of ROOTKIT and iFUND on ETH! \n\n(Credits to Ben in our community for the writeup below)\n\nThis token has revolutionary tokenomics, blowing away the deflationary tokens of the past. There are 2 main mechanisms that combine to make UpBNB go up over time.\n\n#1: Buybacks.\n\nupBNB uses strategic token buybacks to create upward momentum. Buybacks are funded using a new protocol, called ERC-31337, that lets the team re-use locked liquidity to make token purchases via the vault.\n\nLearn more about ERC-31337: https://rootkitfinance.medium.com/the-power-of-a-price-floor-86fa74b59bd1\n\nAdditional funds from taxes on sales add to the buyback Vault, supercharging buyback power. Buybacks can happen at any time, whenever they are most needed and least expected. They happen again and again, and again - serving the best interests of holders. \n\n#2: Price Floor.\n\nThe ERC-31337 protocol also creates a price floor. Tokens from buybacks are burned, decreasing supply. Over 5% of original tokens have been burned in less than a week. As these tokens are destroyed, the locked liquidity pool stays the same size, creating a floor price that the token can't fall below. That means that unlike many tokens, $upBNB always retains value based on the base token (in this base BNB) and can't never go to zero. If you acquired tokens at the price floor, you literally CAN NOT LOSE. Liquidity below the price floor is recycled into MORE BUYBACKS, accelerating upward momentum.\n\nThe most exciting part is that the dev team has a plan to construct an entire upToken ecosystem, with ROOT as the governance token and upBNB as the hub token of future BSC upTokens.\n\nLearn more about the ecosystem: https://rootkitfinance.medium.com/developing-the-uponly-ecosystem-4a538f121b8c\n\nupBNB is designed for holders who believe in the value of the upEcosystem. The same technology on Eth, in the ROOT token, did over 25x and is climbing back to ALL TIME HIGHS 6 months later.\n\nupBNB can be acquired on PancakeSwap V2, with 0.5%-1% slippage to buy. Sell slippage resets to 15% when a buyback occurs to prevent dumping, then gradually falls to around 7% over the course of 5 days.\n\nJoin us and be apart of the most elite of DEGENS on BSC \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f \n\n\ud83d\udc49 Contract: 0x9c3bbff333f4aeab60b3c060607b7c505ff30c82\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Chart: https://dex.guru/token/0x9c3bbff333f4aeab60b3c060607b7c505ff30c82-bsc\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Pancake (V2): https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?outputCurrency=0x9c3bbff333f4aeab60b3c060607b7c505ff30c82\n\n\ud83d\udc49 CoinGecko: https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/upbnb\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Telegram: https://t.me/rootkitfinance\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Medium: https://rootkitfinance.medium.com\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Twitter: https://twitter.com/rootkitfinance\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Team site: https://rootkit.finance\n\n\ud83d\udc49 More info on revolutionary tokenomics:\n\nhttps://rootkit.trydiscourse.com/t/the-apes-guide-to-rootkit-finance/13\n\nhttps://rootkitfinance.medium.com/introducing-upbnb-137412cae72\n\nhttps://rootkitfinance.medium.com/the-power-of-a-price-floor-86fa74b59bd1\n\nhttps://rootkitfinance.medium.com/developing-the-uponly-ecosystem-4a538f121b8c\n\n\ud83d\udc49ELI100 Video about the ERC31337 protocol:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjRiwCGiz2Y\n\n\ud83d\udc49Interview with creator:\n\nhttps://cryptofireside.medium.com/crypto-fireside-1-professor-ponzo-the-mysterious-developer-behind-many-defi-3-0-projects-97adfed51c2c",

        "post_body": "This is the inaugural post for **Forward Thinking Friday**. The intention is that every Friday a post goes up to pool ideas and start looking at where new features are desired, discuss potential future innovation and identify gaps in the market that Decred can fill.\n\n**NO IDEA IS A BAD IDEA - We all have different skill and knowledge levels. This is an open forum to identify, discuss and fine tune the ideas, constraints and solution pathways.**\n\n[Forward Thinking Friday \\(image Courtesy of NASA https:\\/\\/www.nasa.gov\\/multimedia\\/imagegallery\\/iotd.html](https://preview.redd.it/lhix20i63r551.png?width=743&format=png&auto=webp&s=82342e1b496b899d7124e9a0e9227664de9aa49f)\n\nSome bullet points on my list\n\n**1. Hardware wallet support for Tickets.** I have many requests in my DMs for ledger/Trezor support of ticket purchases. I know this requires dev action so it would be ideal for some of the marketing teams to look at recruiting devs who could pick this up. This is important and if there are technical reasons it cannot be done - we should endeavour to solve them.\n\n**2. BTCPay Server and ColdCard support** \\- If The maxi's won't let us in, fork it and make it ours. BTCPay server opens up strong tools for merchant adoption and inclusion of unique features like the Decred DEX and mix server would be a game changer. ColdCards are open source hardware/software and are best in class in my opinion for holding BTC. Would love to see firmware expand for DCR support.\n\n**3. Governance as a Service GaaS (need a better acronym)** \\- How can BTC be locked into a Decred sidechain to participate in a skin-in-the-game vote? How can atomic swaps and LN be used in the same endeavour? How can Decred export Politeia as a service for sub-DAOs? Can we build a system of sub-DAOs with different ticket requirements representative of sub-companies?\n\n**4. Coloured Coins** \\- Tokenising on Decred, could also be a part of the GaaS system above. I personally believe Securities will come to distributed ledgers and Decred is such a high assurance ledger it makes perfect sense to build such features. Note - Review CounterParty functionality\n\n**5. Privacy by Default** \\- Once Mixing is added to Decrediton, I am keen to see features like Mix-and-Send, Mix-to-Receive, PayJoin etc where it increases the probability that most DCR circulating come from/go into a Mix enhancing the privacy across the board. I personally think that mixing should be a toggle option that once set, ensures that all actions on-chain are mixed by default. It is so cheap, this should be fairly non offensive and also creates additional miner income.\n\n**Summary Items from the Comments (as of 22/6)**\n\n\\- Address aliases (potential to include for Lightning Network to deal with longer address problem) - research pay-nyms used by Samurai Wallet\n\n\\- Lightning Network Chat Function (Juggernaut or even a Trollbox) [https://medium.com/@johncantrell97/announcing-juggernaut-5bda48d34a18](https://medium.com/@johncantrell97/announcing-juggernaut-5bda48d34a18)\n\n\\- Update \"Latest News\" section of [decred.org](https://decred.org/) to keep up to date with Journal and progress\n\n\\- Multi-sig functionality built into Decrediton (perhaps linked to Hardware Wallet Integration)\n\n\\- Identity protocol utilising the Politeia identity (with multiple psuedonyms assigned to single verifyable private key) to recapture ownership of social media, content and self-sovereignty.\n\n\\- Flash and play Raspberry Pi Decred node software or custom design cases\n\n\\- LN Crowd Funding",

        "post_body": "I believe that the Stellar project is magnificent and the lumen coin is way way way undervalued to be honest, please let me explain below why I believe that based on my research and my own analysis\n\nStellar is like the other side of the coin when compared to Ripple XRP, they both share a similar system and technology however both have different vision and target market \n\nAs this post is written on the stellar subform then I\u2019ll try to focus more on stellar and will only use xrp in comparisons and won\u2019t talk that much in depth about it\n\nBelow are the reasons why I think Stellar will succeed eventually \n\nThe technology: Stellar is an inter ledger which can be used as an exchange platform to swap commodities and currencies, it is an open source where you can use it for practically anything, you can create your own token or currency! You can exchange fiat money and use stellar lumens as liquidity solution, you can make agreements and so much more, the outer space is the limit! Plus it is faster than most of the solutions out there, XRP is the only solution that can equal the speed of stellar, however at the moment stellar fee is cheaper than xrp \n\nThe Story: here is where Stellar shines, the project is nonprofit and the team behind it have a noble cause for creating the whole project, they aim to make the world a better place, provide easy solutions for poor people and poor countries where transferring money is difficult and expensive, people in general like the heroic stories, and Stellar shine in this subject as they aren\u2019t after making money or greed \n\nThe scalability: Stellar platform can host so many different tokens and currencies and other types of projects and solutions, to put it on perspective, it is like the Android platform, it is a great platform however it only shines if it was adopted by programmers and mobile companies, stellar is the same, the platform is great however it can shine only if people and companies adopted it and used it for their currencies ICO\u2019s and different tech solutions, \n\nFor all of those reasons I believe Stellar can really become something so huge, even bigger than Bitcoin and the rest of the market but it needs more adoptions, I believe the marketing team of stellar will have a huge challenge in front of them to promote the project but if they do it right all of the lumens holders will be happy they did chose stellar \n\nNote: I have invested in both XRP and Stellar and I believe on both projects for different reasons, both can coexist in my opinion and succeed on their different path..",

        "post_body": "I think Ripple is currently merging with SWIFT. Yeah, I said it. Tin foil hat me, bro.\n\nSo, a few weeks ago, SWIFT just randomly stopped trying to build their own blockchain/ledger. I find it heavily suspect that such an absurdly large organization would simply give up on a technology that even they called \"encouraging\". What's odd is that this happened right around the same time that Brad said Ripple was going to stop announcing new banking partnerships. What if SWIFT actually just struck a deal with Ripple to leverage their technology (since they can't seem to build it) and they are currently merging their clients? This would solve SWIFT's tech problem and Ripple's bank relationship problem in one fell swoop.\n\nIt would also explain why Brad is so confident that they will be signing \"a bank a week\" because he knows that with SWIFT on their side, they have their foot in the door with ALL the banks, now it's just paperwork and logistics.\n\nIt would also explain why SWIFT tweeted today that their customers must \"change their interfaces and business systems\" by November. Maybe SWIFT is prepping to flip a switch and have the entire world banking system switch over to xCurrent with the option of using the cheaper and faster xRapid. Maybe, just maybe, SWIFT is full of smart people that know they aren't a Silicon Valley technology company and they would rather focus on their strong suit, banking relationships. Peanut butter, yo.\n\nIt would also explain u/bearableguy123's absurd price prediction of far over $100 in 2018. If his prediction is true, like his track record, Ripple HAS to be growing at an incredible rate behind the scenes and this seems like an obvious shortcut to be able to do so.\n\nMaybe the play isn't to replace SWIFT, it\"s to be SO much better, that you simply become SWIFT.\n\nTin foil hat, off; murderous comments, commence.",

In this case, that would be developers and/or people that are interested investing in crypto. With a very low budget (f.e. $100 in total) you can reach 10.000s and more people that might be interested in NEO. Unfortunately our organic reach isn't very big among other Reddit groups, but advertisement could change that (not the organic reach but awereness of NEO all over Reddit). \n\nA perfect moment for this announcement (which will happen this quarter) is (for example) an advertisement that Binance switched over to N3 and the advertisement could show the biggest advantages of N3.\n\nSince a few weeks we have the !TIP function here on reddit to send GAS. We could select a moderator of the page (or a very (well trusted) active member) to receive the gas that will pay the advertisements.\n\nWe all hold NEO so we all receive gas, if the advertisement work, the price of NEO and gas will rise and we'll all benefit of it. This is the way how we, as a community, could also really add something to the NEO marketing. For 1 ant $100 is much but if you share it among 100 ants it's only $1 (that's how ants work together).Even if it 'doesn't work', we tried (and really did something to improve NEO), at least got a lot of people to see NEO again (created awareness and showed people what N3 is all about, that might join later).\n\nI work in marketing and make a lot of advertisements on social media/Google. It's incredible easy to get success with advertisements that are well targeted. With a small budget you can really get the snowball rolling.\n\nI fully support the idea and hope one of the moderators (or active member) would like to be the trusted person where we could send the tips to. This person can also share the results and costs of the advertisement here in this sub so it'll be completely transparant. I'm NOT going to be receiver of the TIP, so this message could not be claimed as a scam.\n\nHowever, I'm more than happy to help making the advertisement and search for the right target groups.\n\nPlease share this message also in the discord group. Hopefully we'll bring N3 to new heights.",

Well, here it is. For the rest of you who don't know what this is I'll fill you in... Some time back in late November after a night of drinking with some friends I came home and decided to check out /r/bitcoinmarkets to talk about Bitcoins. As you can see [in this thread ](http://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1rmc4m/can_you_guys_stop_bashing_the_bears/)I was so sure of my drunken predictions that I offered to eat a hat on video with ketchup if I was wrong. Well, I was wrong. Bitcoins and alcohol don't go well together. Lesson learned. I decided that I would actually go through with eating the hat but when it came down to it I always had something else I either needed or wanted to do in my free time instead. [In this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1v959g/daily_discussion_wednesday_january_15_2014/ceq1uog) you can see I got called out for not posting the video so I reached out to /u/seansoutpost to hold some of my bitcoins ransom for me until I actually did it.

        "post_title": "A clarification about NEO-Chinese Government cooperation.u/beczka2006",
        "post_body": "As a rather new user of reddit, I would like to express my gratitude to the community for more than 25k views of my articles, almost 1500 karma, dozens of hundreds of pm's and general very positive feedback during the last 4 days. Now let us move to the main topic. \n\nThere is a lot of misinformation about the impact of future Chinese ICO regulations. Firstly, absolutely no official statement from the government has been issued, so all you read about 'bans', 'cancel of events' is either not true, or at least over-interpreted. The ongoing chaos, and likely financial pyramid bubble-schemes that have been forming in the last 1.5 years in the crypto-crowdfunding business, simply forced the regulators to wag their finger at the hundreds of start-ups, thinking about easy fund-raise on smart contracts platforms. \"We know what you are doing, so do not even think about starting a crowdfund without providing legal and safety regulations for your investors\" - that was the informal message that the start-ups received. And as you can see, it was enough to scare a lot of start-ups, thus all those cancellations that have been recently happening. \n\nNow, what does it mean for investors? Most importantly, all the restrictions and cancellations of events that happened last week were voluntary, not forced. This is good news for two reasons. First and foremost, Chinese regulators are showing to start-ups that unless you have a well-funded, legally-complying, promising project  you can only dream about draining gullible investors and forming a speculative bubble. Hence, investors are protected from pyramid schemes. Secondly, the precautionary measures undertaken by the start-ups mean that nobody wants to test Chinese regulators patience, start-ups will have to work harder on their projects before releasing ICO to be compliant. \n\nThe only drawback of this situation is that there is a lot of uncertainty as regulations are yet to come. There are two things that should be very comforting for investors, however. \n1. The above-mentioned precautionary measures undertaken by ICO start-ups mean that Chinese regulators do not really need to reach for drastic measures like bans, as companies (doesnt matter for us if it happened out of fear or logic) wants to obey the rules, even before they were released. \n2. Even though that NEO is an open source blockchain platform and thus it cannot cooperate with governments on future regulations, the creators of NEO funded the private company OnChain (together with 3 other international professionals, one of whom I had the pleasure to meet) that is doing tremendous work here. They are in contact with regulators and local governments, helping and advising the future laws that would benefit the adoption of smart economy. \n\nOnChain creators believe that all the assets must be digitalized in future as businesses and people demand higher liquidity, security and transparency. That is why I would like to highlight why digital identity is on NEO platform from the very beginning. NEO is miles ahead of Ethereum to finally emerge from the grey zone to mainstream adoption. Just be patient, as this will not happen overnight. \n\nPrivate disclaimer (only read if you are interested with more professional subscription-fee service information) :\nAs unfortunately reddit NEO channel is becoming very unprofessional with novice beginners flooding the discussion with absurd comments on speculation of the price, I would be starting professional reports regarding Asian market news first hand rather than publish here. I would like to create a community of investors, but here with all the chaos and no quality news it is next to impossible. Because it requires a lot of work and some expenses as the reliable platforms ie. RedPulse that I cover with my private money the subscription cost will be 1NEO per first 3 months. The subscription allows you to receive monthly reports on the 15th every month on your email, written by me and my associates, plus I will answer your private questions/advice requests daily on your email. I answered literally almost a thousand private pms in the last 4 days, and it is so time-consuming and ineffective, so that is why I made the decision to work with the most serious investors.  In case anyone is interested, PM me for the details. Those who are unintrested, I would like to just reassure you that you have invested in one of the most promising cryptocurrency in history and please educate yourself, travel to business meetings, meet people, learn languages. Or get eaten by whales and misinformation. \n\nPS.2 This month report, due to the RedPulse ICO will be released on the 6th of September, not 15th to inform investors early on. Subscriptions made after 6th of September will receive monthly report on October, but still can send daily emails with questions/advice. \n\nBest regards. u/beczka2006\n\n",

I travelled extensively and had the chance to be employed in different parts of the world including the Middle East, Eastern Europe and South East Asia. Rest assured that I am fully aware of our bias as westerners. My point being that China is a very complex to understand even for Chinese themselves. Depending on who you talk to or area you travel, you will have very different interpretations and even contradictory facts for the same story. China is far from an homogeneous society. So it requires a lot of research and time to shape a fair opinion on China and I don't pretend to be an expert on the subject. However, there are a few things that I know for sure:\n\n1- Policies, laws and regulations changes very rapidly and drastically over there. The CPC reacts very swiftly when it feels threaten.\n2- Corruption is endemic. If you know the right people or if you bribe the right officials, you can get away with (some) stuff, has long as it's not attracting too much attention.\n3- The decentralized nature of the crypto is incompatible with a centrally planned society and economy.\n\nFor those reasons, my assomption is that NEO and similar projects will continu to evolve for a certain period of time up until it gets traction with the Chinese people and eventually threaten the regime. At that point, authorities will take actions to regulate further, and even severely restrict... Just food for thought."

There's only been people here and on XMR trader shouting for months that exchanges directly invovled with new Tether prints are probably fractionally reserved. We've been explaining that they're probably using any real Monero on their exchanges to maintain leveraged shorts with price suppression. And that's in addition to the naked short that selling non-existent Monero actually is.\n\nIf you leave your XMR on BitFinex, Poloniex, Binance, Huobi, or any exchange that receives new Tether prints, you're hurting us. Use a *reputable* regulated exchange if you're gonna trade. Kraken is probably the best here, and they're very likely fully reserved. They're trying to integrate into the banking system, and generally can't afford to do those kinds of manipulation and lies.\n\nOr just use a decentralized exchange. Or better yet, *stop trading.* Most people get rekt doing it. We need to squeeze the shit out of liquidity on these price manipulators. It's time to put an end to this. They don't have loads of ASIC mined and premined Monero to dump on retail. They hate that they can't see the onchain flows. They want to suppress price and make Monero their own personal little laundromat.\n\nMonero is for *The People* not for a narrow set of corporate parasites. Pull your damn coins OFF of the exchanges.\n\nDo it NOW.\"",

Something of this scale should take a day, maybe a week.\nAt the very least, not 4 weeks and especially not 4 weeks if its months over schedule (which by the way, it also was a year ago).\n\nI would like to request to make a transparency report for the Monero General Fund a top priority. That includes the overdue 2020 report and also a report for the first months of 2021.\n\nI have a very bad feeling about the things that are coming to light as of late and would love to be proven wrong.\n\nEDIT 2\nOn transparency reports\nhttps://web.getmonero.org/2019/12/03/core-team-general-fund.html\nDated december 2019\nWe would like to institute more transparency going forward for the General Fund. We will publish regular reports, probably *quarterly*. We will include donations that have been received, how much and how the funds have been allocated, and what is the state of the \u201creserves\u201d. You can expect the first such report soon.\n\n\n\nEDIT also i would like to urgently propose so somehow change the mechanism that control the actual funds. In light of the recent donations (several hundred K in USD) i feel very uncomfortable with the way the funds are controlled seemingly by a single person that is unable to provide transparency reports on a consistent basis.",

One of the traders I follow on Twitter mentioned when they transfer from one exchange to another they do so with XRP. So I figured I'd try it out to see how fast I could move funds from one exchange to another.\n\nI bought $50 in XRP on coinbase pro and moved it to Kraken where I do my day trading. I expected a few minutes at least but I clicked withdrawl and by the time I click my Kraken browser and hit refresh my funds had moved for a fee of a whopping $0.00\n\nI usually rip on the blind faith following that XRP has but now I understand why it has it. I'll never transfer from exchange - exchange with anything other than XRP again.\n\nEdit: Thanks for the gold! My first gold.\n\nEdit 2: Thanks for the platinum! Another first.",

Nanex had the much higher price so I sold there for bitcoin, thinking that would make it easier for myself. \n\nHaving acquired my bitcoin on nanex I requested to withdraw my funds paying the $2 fee, thinking I'd receive my funds within the hour.

Three hours into waiting with still zero confirmations comes the coinmarketcap listing & bitcoin private shoots up like someone lit a rocket up its Ass!

Haveno is a fork of the [Bisq exchange](https://bisq.network/), a decentralized exchange used to trade Bitcoin for national currencies and other cryptos. Haveno is based on Monero, making it **more private** and **cheaper** than Bisq (more info in the [README of the repository](https://github.com/haveno-dex/haveno).\n\nHaveno uses peer-to-peer networking and multi-signature escrow to facilitate trading without a trusted third party custodian. Disputes can be resolved using non-custodial arbitration.\n\nThe project has a core team, at the moment composed of myself (ErCiccione) and Woodser, the lead developer.\n\n## What's the status of the project\nThe platform has a long road to go before being available for public use. As said, the PoC is ready, but everything else needs to be done. We are tracking development using GitHub's issues and projects. Please take a look at  the ['Status of the project' section of the README](https://github.com/haveno-dex/haveno#status-of-the-project), but basically the most important tasks we are working on are:\n\n- **We need a logo**. Right now it's a random stock image ([#1](https://github.com/haveno-dex/haveno-meta/issues/1))\n- **The User Interface is basically still Bisq**. Needs to be completely reworked and adapted for Monero as base currency (https://github.com/haveno-dex/haveno/projects/2). We are already in contact with an interested designer, but nothing has been decided yet.\n- **Clean-up the repository** from Bisq-specific content (https://github.com/haveno-dex/haveno/projects/1)\n\n## How can the community help?\nNow we badly need:\n\n- Contributors\n- Funds\n\nIf you can help in any way, please let us know. Right now we mostly need coders (Java), network experts (for the underlying P2P/Tor infrastructure) and designers, but any help in any field would be really appreciated. Just contact us and let's build Haveno together!\n\n**Funds are also fundamental at this stage**. If you can, please [sponsor](https://github.com/haveno-dex/haveno#sponsors) or [donate](https://github.com/haveno-dex/haveno#support) to the project. We are thinking of incentive development through bounties, but we will also need funds to continue development. We are also considering opening a CCS proposal, but that will be decided later on, also depending by how much funds we are going to get without CCS.\n\n## Where are we?\nThe [haveno-dex GitHub organization](https://github.com/haveno-dex) is our base. The main repository where the code sleeps is [haveno](https://github.com/haveno-dex/haveno), but we also have a [haveno-meta](https://github.com/haveno-dex/haveno-meta) repository, used for proposals and project-wide issues/features that need to be added/discussed.\n\nWe have two rooms on Matrix, where we discuss and coordinate:\n\n- **Haveno** (`#haveno:haveno.network` - [invite link](https://matrix.to/#/!IEFpSeJArnlszBCPzh:haveno.network?via=haveno.network): For general discussions about the project (relayed on Freenode: `#haveno`)\n- **Haveno Dev** (`#haveno-dev:haveno.network` - [Invite link](https://matrix.to/#/!HeVhOlajgOuVMOKhvS:haveno.network?via=haveno.network&via=monero.social&via=matrix.org)): For development related coordination and support (relayed on Freenode: `#haveno-dev`)\n\n## The question everybody want to ask\nYes, Woodser is already working in implementing atomic swaps for XMR <-> BTC trades on Haveno :)\n\nWe are very excited to finally go public and we are looking forward to hear your thoughts! :)",

        "post_title": "An open letter to the core team",
        "post_body": "Dear Core team,\n\nI am writing this open letter after observing what I consider to be flagrant examples of conflict of interest on behalf of Diego \u201crehrar\u201d Salazar, Monero\u2019s only salaried employee and the founder of CypherStack. I am writing in a personal capacity and not as a representative of any workgroup or as a spokesperson for anyone else. Hopefully, this letter induces others to voice their opinion on the subject, whether positive or negative, so that you may determine if the status quo should remain or if change is needed.\n\nThe most recent example was the [proposed](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/nxkyoi/update_on_triptych_multisig_proposal/), and later [scrapped](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/nxkyoi/update_on_triptych_multisig_proposal/h1kn4ml?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), plan for CypherStack to open a second funding proposal to make up for exchange rate fluctuations on their original proposal. I hope you followed that discussion in its entirety and read the many opinions that were voiced therein. This request seemed to rub many the wrong way, not because of the small shortfall of a few XMR, but because of the insinuation that further research work by a valued contributor who now works under CypherStack would be withheld in the future if that demand were not met. The Monero project attracts the sort of people who do not take well to ultimatums and this latest episode made evident that many would accept the loss of any individual contributor if the alternative meant bowing to the demands of some corporate entity.\n\nIn addition to (recently) founding CypherStack, Diego has been working for you as Monero\u2019s only salaried employee since 2017. When it was [revealed in 2019](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/hjixed/general_fund_transparency_report_2019_june_2020/) that this arrangement had been going on for two and a half years, many people in the community felt that their trust had been betrayed and I shared their feelings. Our rainy-day fund had been severely depleted. I have not felt comfortable donating to the General Fund since. We asked for details about Diego\u2019s role and the work he was performing for you but did not receive a satisfactory response. Diego put out a [transparency report](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/iteivi/rehrar_transparency_report/), which was not received warmly. He had also committed to putting out a [monthly report](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/i8hbr8/monero_community_workgroup_is_preparing_for_the/g1nq8sa?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) about the work he was doing. No such reports followed.\n\nThe existence of a single, salaried employee within the ranks of hundreds of unpaid volunteers (and a few paid ones who regularly must ask for donations and do not have the safety of a stable, dollar-denominated income) ruffled some feathers, but people generally got over it and work continued unabated. I rationalized it by thinking that having a talented contributor who is engaged with Monero on a full-time basis was a win for the project and that the initial lack of communication could be overcome. I was not unwittingly contributing to his salary anymore so what did it bother me? And it did not, until Diego\u2019s many other engagements began to represent what I consider to be a conflict of interest and a liability to the project.\n\nMy specific complaints:\n\n* Diego was one of the 3 people who formed the ill-fated [Monero Community Workgroup, LLC](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/i8hbr8/monero_community_workgroup_is_preparing_for_the/), which was seen by many as an attempt to put the work of numerous unpaid volunteers under private ownership, although he did [back out of it](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/i9qc74/rehrar_clarification_on_the_llc/) as soon as he felt which way the wind was blowing. As a result, the other 2 people involved relinquished control over the workgroup and handed it to Core, which in effect meant handing it to Diego, since he administers the group as part of his responsibilities for Core. In short, Diego\u2019s position only improved as a result of this debacle.\n* He provides paid services to other participants in the Monero ecosystem (e.g., his work for[Local Monero](https://localmonero.co/knowledge?language=en)) while simultaneously receiving payment from the public coffers. This is akin to working in the public and private sectors simultaneously and can be seen as trading on influence. This also means that Diego now has a financial interest in keeping Local Monero (or any of his other clients) in Core\u2019s good graces. This could easily evolve into people hiring Diego to curry favor with Core for one reason or another. While Core members have (and have had) businesses in the Monero ecosystem, which necessitates some level of financial interaction with various ecosystem participants, this is arguably OK because Core members are unpaid volunteers. I would hold an employee paid by community funds to a higher standard.\n* He works for competing projects. An example is the [Firo rebrand](https://twitter.com/firoorg/status/1324430879226167296?s=20). I do not have to explain why this is disagreeable.\n* By leveraging his position with the core team, Diego has successfully attracted long-time contributors to his outsourcing enterprise, CypherStack, and is hiring them back out to the Monero community at a profit. While producing the benefit of bringing those contributors back to Monero, it is another example of Diego profiting off Monero and trading on the influence afforded to him by his position with Core. [Non-profit options were offered to him](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/nxkyoi/update_on_triptych_multisig_proposal/h1karq2?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and rejected. ([I voiced my concerns](https://monerologs.net/monero-community/20210408#c224632) immediately upon that announcement and was informed that [Core was briefed](https://monerologs.net/monero-community/20210409#c224758) and was OK with this arrangement. I had a [separate discussion](https://libera.monerologs.net/monero-community/20210612#c587) with Diego on IRC after his most recent request.)\n* Through CypherStack, he lends the same valued Monero contributors to competing projects, [namely Firo](https://firo.org/2021/04/10/research-acceleration.html). The leader of that project then publicly bragged about poaching a particular contributor from Monero and used it as an example of why his project is superior to Monero. In this way, CypherStack inflicted reputational damage to Monero.\n* In connection with the above, while formulating his [first funding proposal](https://repo.getmonero.org/monero-project/ccs-proposals/-/merge_requests/222) to the Monero community, Diego neglected to mention that he already had a full-time agreement for the same contractor with Firo and only [added a vague note about this small detail](https://repo.getmonero.org/monero-project/ccs-proposals/-/merge_requests/222/diffs?commit_id=ab51373fa1f65c79bd034b59c2cd2ea754c23659) two days before the CCS was merged and after all the discussion had been had. Monero did not receive the option of hiring that contributor on a full-time basis, despite the existing desire and ability to pay for full-time work, and settled for second place. This shows that CypherStack\u2019s priorities (and by extension, Diego\u2019s) do not lie with the Monero project.\n* CypherStack falsely advertised itself as the solution to volatility for erstwhile contributors while lacking sufficient reserves or mechanisms to provide it. This became evident when a $2000 shortfall caused by predictable factors resulted in threats to \u201c[pause XMR research work](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/nxkyoi/update_on_triptych_multisig_proposal/h1itrfx?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\u201d.\n\nIn short, while Diego has shown himself to be a talented contributor and a maybe even more talented entrepreneur, his priorities are not fully aligned with those of the Monero project. I want to encourage the Core team to help Diego decide whether he wants to be an employee of Monero or whether he wants to provide services to the Monero project (and any other projects and companies he wishes) as an independent contributor/volunteer, just like everyone else. I would personally prefer the second option.\n\nIf Diego is unable to fulfill the role of a Core employee who puts the community\u2019s interests before his own and refrains from lending himself and others out to any bidder that comes along, then I would urge the core team to find someone who is willing to serve solely in that capacity. It would be appreciated if that selection process were done openly and funding be completed through the CCS, even if Core chooses to guarantee any shortfall through the General Fund. It is also worth noting that there are plenty of talented people within the community who would likely perform the work for little or no pay, because they [actually hold XMR](https://youtu.be/9PZkIteyyTM?t=2690) and the project\u2019s success is aligned with their personal success.\n\nWhoever is to serve in a role that is funded by community donations should be subject to the standards and practices of the CCS and produce monthly or bi-monthly reports about their work.  When I recently asked Diego about his missing reports again, he said that he is accountable only to Core and that no future reports will be made because they are [a waste of his time](https://youtu.be/9PZkIteyyTM?t=1809). I sincerely hope that the core team does not regard its responsibilities to the community in the same way.\n\nYours,\n\ngeonic\n\n\\-------------------\n\nedit: so far, Diego has chosen to respond and answer the community's questions on IRC.

        "post_body": "A new age of community participation is about to start on the IOTA network. A decision has to be made about what will happen to a total of about 60 Terra-IOTA (= 60,000,000 MIOTA, currently worth around 50 million USD) that lie dormant on the IOTA 1.0 network. This decision will be made by YOU and the rest of the IOTA community. All token holders will be able to vote for this important decision directly inside their Firefly wallets. The two options are:\n\na) BUILD with these tokens (spend them on community projects)\n\nb) BURN those tokens (lock them away so nobody will ever be able to use them)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Where do these 60 Ti come from?**\n\nMost of the tokens at stake were sold at IOTAs original crowd-sale in 2016, but were never claimed by their respective buyers. Others remain unclaimed since a network-transition in the beginnings of 2017. After five years of trying to find the owners the IOTA Foundation gave out a final deadline to claim these tokens, pledging to give the remaining ones into the hands of the IOTA community. This deadline passed and now it is onto you to decide about their future.\n\n**Who can vote?**\n\nAll IOTA token holders!\n\nYour voting weight will be determined by two factors:\n\n1. How many tokens do you use for this vote (100 MIOTA have 10-times more voting power than 10 MIOTA)\n2. How long do you not move your tokens during the voting period (probably about two weeks). Lower holding times will result in proportionally lower voting weight (for example, if two weeks will be defined as 100% voting weight, then holding them still for one week will result in 50% of voting weight).\n\n**!!Important!!**\n\n\u00b7 Voting is completely **for free** (no costs, no fees)\n\n\u00b7 Voting is completely **voluntary** (you will neither directly gain or lose anything by casting your vote).\n\n\u00b7 You will have **100% control of your tokens at all times** (tokens stay at your address)\n\n\u00b7 Your **tokens do not get locked** in this process (you can use them for something else at any time)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**How do I vote?**\n\nYou will be able to vote with your tokens **directly inside your official Firefly wallet** (supporting version will be released before the election, expected later this year). This version will have a completely new voting window with a clean design and a clear and easy user-interface (see mock-up pictures below as an example).\n\nIn case you vote, Firefly will send your tokens to your own address (this means they effectively don\u2019t move and they never leave your control). This transaction will carry your decision as a data-load. Your decision as well as your voting weight will be fully transparent on the IOTA Tangle. As every transaction on IOTA **your vote will be pseudonymous** (the address will be public, however your name or other personal information will never enter the network in any way).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The options: Build or Burn!**\n\n**Option A: BUILD**\n\nIf the majority of tokens votes for \u201cbuild\u201d, a decentralized form of organization (for example a DAO) will be set up by community members in order control these 60 Ti. This organization will be fully controlled by the IOTA community via token-weighted democracy or another system, that the community decides on. IOTA-focused projects that want to receive funds could be able to apply for payments according to rules that will be created and voted on by the community. Community-vote will always decide, if these funds are paid out.\n\nThis organization would be built under **democratic supervision** of the community: Important decisions will be up for vote about every 4-6 weeks within your Firefly wallet (participation is of course voluntary).\n\n**Option B: BURN**\n\nIf the majority of tokens vote to \u201cburn\u201d, no DAO will be build and instead all tokens in question will remain unmigrated into the current IOTA 1.5 (Chrysalis) network. This will irreversibly lock these tokens away, prohibiting anyone from ever using them again for any purpose.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Preliminary design of the new voting-windows in Firefly**\n\n**Vote proposal window**\n\nInside your voting menu you can see all ongoing votes regarding the IOTA treasury DAO. At the beginning you will only find the \"build or burn\" vote.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p8yrkj1uqvj71.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9e775be9582af1c640442e3d563beed66d1a5a7\n\n**Proposal details**\n\nIn the details page of any proposal you can find all important information about the vote that is to be decided on, including the exact meaning of both voting options. Here you will also find the buttons enabling you to cast your vote\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7jjcg5fvqvj71.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=29d51374659ee9624c2e65a1055a7df7e235aa0d\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Join the community efforts now!**\n\nThe IOTA treasury governance is a real grassroots development and thrives from community participation.

        "post_body": "u/MemoryDealers\n\nHi Roger, I know you've received a lot of flak for daring to publicly speak positively about Dash in this toxic and hateful crypto-environment and for that our entire community applauds you. But I have also noticed you've been spammed with lies and nonsensical information about Dash's privacy model by our detractors. Let me correct the record here. \n\nI've explained how Dash PrivateSend works in the past:\n\n>Imagine you walk up to a table with 2 other guys and each of you throws like ten 1 Dollar bills on that table. Then you ask a complete stranger to shuffle these thirty 1 Dollar bills around for you guys.\n\n>When he's done each of you takes out exactly 10 Dollars from that pile. Now could you tell which one of these dollar bills was in a drug trade 2 weeks ago? From this point on the bills are fully fungible no matter their previous history.\n\n>And now imagine doing the same exact thing on another table with two different guys and then again on another table, again with 2 other guys... up to 8 times in a row. That's how mixing with Masternodes works.\n\n>It's important to point out that a Masternode never holds your funds. It just sends out a mixing request to the network on your behalf to enable you to mix with other people. The actual mixing of funds is done by your Qt-wallet (the complete stranger in my analogy) once it has found 2 other parties to mix with.\n\nAnd I have explained the chances of \"breaking\" PrivateSend.\n\n>[Here are the infeasibly small chances of successfully tracing a **single** transaction at a time](http://i.imgur.com/FfxkEBf.png)\n\n>The more Masternodes there are the lower the probabilities get, obviously.\n\n>And once the mixing has happened you'll never be able to [retroactively crack PrivateSend.](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=421615.msg14031652#msg14031652) because the laws of mathematics never change. Once you're done (and you only need mix once!) you can spend from this mixed balance anonymously virtually forever.\n\nLet me add to that the following: Even if someone actually spent the effort, time and money for the tiny chance of successfully tracing a transaction this would **not** break the entire system of PrivateSend. They'd have to expend the same effort *again* and *again* and *again* for each transaction with the same or even smaller chances (due to more Masternodes coming online over time). Thus Dash's privacy model consists of **infinite points of failure** if you will.\n\nThis does **not** apply for solutions like CryptoNote. [Read more about that here](https://steemit.com/cryptonote/@macrochip/warning-every-cryptonote-monero-transaction-in-history-will-be-retroactively-exposed) and you will realize that obscuring an entire blockchain is a centralized point of failure and in the long term a recipe for desaster\n\nAnother thing, more of a sidenote: PrivateSend is not equal to \"CoinJoin\". It is heavily modified and extended and thus its own being. CoinJoin suffers from timing- and denomination-linking-analysis attacks, both of which Dash has fixed via before-time mixing and pre-determined denominations. Also mixing is much faster since our 12.1 release if you enable \"PrivateSend Multisession\" in the Configuration of your Dash Client. \n\nI hope you feel well informed and enabled to make out the nonsense after this and recognize that Dash's privacy model is not only \"good enough\" as a privacy solution but also **future-proof**. A mixed transaction can never be traced retroactively. The last thing you want is a time limit on your anonymity.",

        "post_body": "So, let me get this straight...\n\nIn 2004, Ryan Fugger got this idea of creating a global decentralized monetary system that could allow individuals/communities to create their own money. This led to the creation of RipplePay.com (2005).\n - This was even before the release of the legendary Bitcoin whitepaper by Satoshi Nakamoto, which was in 2008.\n\nFast forwarding to 2011 : Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto and David Schwartz get together, foresees the problems Bitcoin is going to face in the future (i.e. now), and starts developing a digital currency (XRP) which is faster, cheaper and more energy efficient than Bitcoin.\n\n2012 : Chris Larsen joins the team. They approach Ryan Fugger, after long discussions, who handed over the reins. Thus, OpenCoin was founded.\n\n2013 : OpenCoin becomes Ripple Labs.\n\n2014 : Ripple, seeing the massive potential of blockchain technology, proposed Codius. Codius is a project to develop a new\u00a0smart contract\u00a0system. Ripple sort of benched Codius to focus on international remittances.\n- Ethereum was proposed late 2013 and went live in 2015.\n\nRipple's vision of \"not one, but many blockchains\" led to the creation of the Interledger Protocol which lets different blockchains and networks interoperate.\n\n2018 : CODIUS IS BACK!\n Stefan Thomas (inventor of the Interledger Protocol) steps down as CTO of Ripple and launches his project Coil, which aims to allow micropayments for content management. It will be using Interledger Protocol, and carry XRP tokens for monetization.\n\nMy point is :\n\nRipple is building a completely game changing ecosystem. How ?\n\nWell, they took on the top 2 cryptocurrencies....\n\n[- Bitcoin focussed on being a global currency. But XRP can, right now, do everything Bitcoin can wayyy better.\n- Ethereum focussed on smart contracts. Codius is back ! Let's see where that goes.]\n\n....and at the same time, they are on the cusp of ANNIHILATING, oh well, the biggest payment network in the world (SWIFT).\n \n\n\n#RipplesGlobalTakeover",

Stellar is much, much more than an improved Ripple. I'll tell you exactly why Lumens are going to grow exponentially this year: Stellar and IBM actually have a plan and the tech to onboard the masses.\n\nLet's backtrack a bit. What have we learned about the Stellar network in the last few months?\n\n1. Stellar partnered with IBM to build infrastructure to support real life cryptocurrency use\n2. FairX will launch on the Stellar network. We'll have a distributed fiat exchange.. XLM/USD, XLM/ETH, XLM/NEO, XLM/ARK, etc\n3. Stellar has announced a major market maker to come, which will add a ton of liquidity to the Stellar platform. Speculation starts at large world banks\n4. It has been confirmed that Stellar is building [cryptocurrency ATM's](https://twitter.com/michaeldowling/status/930677179557564417). There was one launched in Asia and a lot of speculation that Stellar is currently planning to put them in a lot of major cities globally in 2018.\n\nStellar is building the infrastructure to bring cryptocurrency to the masses THIS YEAR. In 2018. People will have the ability to drive to an ATM, turn their cash into Lumens and trade directly for whatever they want on FairX. All with miniscule fees, and without dealing with a centralized exchange.\n\nCan Bitcoin and Litecoin do this? No, absolutely not. I've used BTC and LTC ATMs. You pay a 15%+ premium both ways because the networks are so expensive to use. ATMs are not actually a valid use case for these currencies. It's ridiculous.\n\nCan Ethereum do this? Maybe by 2020, but certainly not in 2018. Ethereum can't currently scale to the level needed to build real world infrastructure and the solutions aren't all that close.\n\nEnter Stellar. They're launching the platform cryptocurrency needs to succeed, right now.\n\nIt doesn't matter what crypto does best this year. It doesn't matter what's popular this summer. Whatever it is that people want, LUMENS will be the first cryptocurrency they purchase. It'll be fast, cheap, and AVAILABLE to the masses. And once they own  their first Lumens, they'll buy/sell/trade on the Stellar network.",

But there's a reason Google bought Nest and Amazon bought Ring; it's hard to compete with someone who has *years* of experience in uncharted territory. At a certain point it's hard to compete; Ripple's entire 150+ employee **business** is about Blockchain and DLT; Sure **you** can also *speculate* and say that Oracle, Apple, IBM may step in; but Ripple has essentially six years testing, growing pains, and experience that you can't fast tract (like SWIFT attempted to do in a matter of months.) Their GPI implementation wasn't to succeed, it was to damage blockchain and slow it down, all they have going for them is complacency of banks. But money talks, and if xRapid saves money it doesn't matter if it's faster, etc; banks can use the savings to fill their pockets, they don't care that it's better as well.\n\nRipple is playing a zero sum game. They are growing a business and achieving every landmark they promised. They'll fail spectacularly or be a mainstay of the ILP and  share a relationship or take over SWIFT. Of course this is *speculation*, but you using that as an argument applies to every ICO in existence, the difference is Ripple is far ahead in the game. Where's BTC, EOS or IOTAs Glassdoor reviews? Oh that's right, they aren't actually companies. XD"

How is it different? What issues does it solve?](https://www.reddit.com/r/NEO/comments/6p7fvu/basic_knowledge_and_background_info_resources/)**\n\n2. **[How to speedup the windows wallet sync?](https://www.reddit.com/r/NEO/comments/6p7fk1/tutorial_how_to_speedup_neo_blockchain/)**\n\n3. **How to use the desktop wallet?**\n *  A1: **[Basic wallet guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/Antshares/comments/6j8pcp/a_basic_guide_to_the_antshares_pc_wallet)**\n *  A2: **[Special attention for wallets with multiple addresses aka \"Change mechanism\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/Antshares/comments/6k7vxi/attention_behaviour_of_desktop_wallet_with/)**\n *  A3: **[Many wallet questions answered in the replies of this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Antshares/comments/6ie1kg/wallets/)**\n\n4. **I withdrew my NEO from an exchange but they are not showing up in my desktop wallet**\n * A1: Stay calm. Currently there are plenty reasons why this could be the case. The most likely ones: Wallet not synced (see sync speedup FAQ), corrupted DB (try rebuilding index via wallet menu), firewall prevents sync (grant wallet access in windows firewall). Try to re-install the client or switch to another wallet (e.g. NEO web or OTCGO web). A more user-friendly light weighted wallet is on the way (CoZ Electron Wallet). To be reassured that your assets are safe, use one of the block explorer (side-bar) and enter your public address.\n\n5. **I imported my web wallet to the desktop wallet using the private key (WIF) but balance shows 0?**\n *  A1: See 4.\n\n6. **[How to claim GAS (former Antcoins)?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Antshares/comments/6eddt1/antcoins_anc_distribution_and_claim_tutorial/)**\n\n7. **Do i have to keep the wallet(s) open in order to gain GAS?**\n *  A1: No. The moment you moved NEO away from exchanges you will generate GAS (Binance.com does credit GAS as well, no moving necessary) Use one of the GAS calculators in the side bar to calculate GAS.\n\n8. **[How to buy GAS (former AntCoins) on 19800?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Antshares/comments/6kjgha/guide_for_buying_antcoin_on_19800com/)**\n\n9. **I just want to buy&hold - how to go about it?**\n * A1: Buy NEO/GAS from one of the exchanges listed in the side-bar. Generate a paper wallet (see sidebar) and move your NEO to the generated address. Keep a copy of the paper wallet!\n\n10. **[How to import wallet from web client into the desktop client?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Antshares/comments/6j6h0b/how_to_import_wallet_from_web_client_into_the/)**\n\n11. **How does NEOs dBFT consensus mechanism work?**\n * A1: [NEO Docs explanation](https://github.com/neo-project/docs/blob/master/en-us/node/consensus.md)\n * A2: [dBFT For Beginners](https://www.reddit.com/r/NEO/comments/6vlatx/dbft_beginners_explanation/)\n\n12. **[How does NEOs dBFT compare to Ethereums PoS consensus mechanism?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Antshares/comments/6nemjr/in_response_to_neo_vs_eth_security_dbft/)**\n\n13. **The NEO team holds 50M NEO, will this cause inflation?**\n *  A1: [Press conference by the Team [Video + English subtitles]](https://www.reddit.com/r/Antshares/comments/6nf62x/press_conference_on_50m_ans_distribution_june/)\n *  A2: [NEO inflation schedule](https://www.reddit.com/r/Antshares/comments/6knw16/antshares_inflation_schedule/)\n\n14. **Is there a fee for transactions?**\n *  A1: No - sending NEO is free.

I've had a few different opinions myself, but having more discussion, /u/Time_Value_of_Money has swayed me into wanting to adopt the pure circle green logo like [Coinbase](https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/screen-shot-2017-12-19-at-9-36-25-pm.png).\n\nFirst, please take a look at the logo on Coinmarketcap.com. It does not fit. It does not look good. It looks weak. Take another look here: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DTZJp7_WkAASn7l.jpg:large Also looks very weak and appearing smaller than its counterparts. We want the full circle and full size B. We want the logo to be as big and as bold as possible. \n\n/u/Time_Value_of_Money explains...\n\n> **A rectangle is not a good use of square screen real estate - see the BCH logo on the front-page of coinmarketcap.com. A [green] circular logo, or at least more \"square\" logo fits limited screen real estate better.** \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoincash/comments/7q0sbg/does_anyone_else_find_the_new_round_background_in/dsluq2p/\n\n> **I agree I like the pure circle. Coinbase green pastel circle to be exact. Coinmarketcap and others will look to r/Bitcoincash as a \"reference\". The logo we champion is a lighthouse to the broader world. Our decision on logo style and color matters here.**\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoincash/comments/7q0sbg/does_anyone_else_find_the_new_round_background_in/dslvaay/\n\n> **Yes! Exactly! A rectangle is a poor use of \"square\" or \"circular\" screen real estate.**\n\n>**Moreover, we need to use green as a means to differentiate. I am convinced Coinbase has done it's due diligence on choosing a purely circular green pastel logo.**\n\n>**Orange is a disliked color by most people. Remember, our audience is NOT current BCH or former BTC users, it is people who do not own a single satoshi. Second, I can't find the source, but I recall seeing research pastel colors like Coinbase's are more welcoming than darker colors.**\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoincash/comments/7q0sbg/does_anyone_else_find_the_new_round_background_in/dslvq61/\n\n\nThese reasons have me completely convinced that we should adopt the pure green circle with upward tilted  \"B\" as the logo for Bitcoin Cash similar or the same to how Coinbase presents it. We should apply it to /r/bitcoincash and get Coinmarketcap to change it ASAP. \n\nedit: here is a visual of the Coinbase BCH logo photoshopped onto CMC: https://i.imgur.com/i8ul4Kn.jpg\nDiscuss. \n",

Few weeks ago, I made a BNB transaction from trust wallet to binance and forgot to include the correct MEMO ID due to which I did not get my funds to show up at binance. So I had raised a ticket with binance and never heard back. I got frustrated with their lack of response for a long time and sent a message to binance on Twitter saying that they are not responding to my ticket and still did not get a response. On that note, I got an message from one of the groups on Twitter saying that they are from trust wallet and they can help me with this issue. I was sure a fool and believed that they are truly from trust wallet and I did whatever they asked me to do in hopes to recover back my incorrect BNB transaction. I gave them access to my wallet like an idiot by sharing the secret key that they asked me to do and they swiped my wallet clean and left zero balance. I lost a $5,000 worth of coins and one of those coins is 16x today from the time I purchased. So they swiped close to $80,000 from my wallet including the profits I could have made. \n\nThis leads me to think, there must be so many innocent and naive people like me out there. Have any of you faced such an situation ?. Please do NOT do the mistake I did. While this was such an frustrating situation for me to come in terms with, I learnt a valuable lesson for life which I will take with me until I die. I want everyone who is innocent or rather naive and stupid like me to learn from my horrible experience. The feeling is horrendous. I can\u2019t believe that I lost close to $80,000 in a jiffy. Please learn from my experience and never do such a thing I did. Please share your experience if you have any. \n\nLastly I want to combat these brats who claim to be TrustWallet and the ones who steal crypto from wallets. How do we do that ?. I really want to make them cry one day like how they are doing this to possibly thousands of people.",

        "post_title": "I spent a week deep-diving into the neo-project source code. What discovered was a plethora of bugs and protocol issues.",
        "post_body": "Let's start by saying that I am and have been a devoted NEO user and an early supporter of various projects employed on the platform. I am not trying to discredit this project, just trying to express my opinion about the direction in which the platform should continue improving. With that out of the way, let's go:\n\n1.  Problem: The number of transactions per block is capped at 500 (or a theoretical maximum of 33 tps [transactions per second]). Making Da Hong Fei's claim regarding \"1000 tps\" as valid as a similar potential claim by a member of Bitcoin Core (Bitcoin caps each block at 1Mb).\nSolution: Unfortunately, a solution to this issue is a compromise between scalability and decentralization.\n\n2. Problem: Each block header contains a multisig [multiple signature] entry as a proof of consensus. The size of a multisig is proportional to the number of signing bookkeeper nodes (minimum threshold is equal to 2n/3 + 1), with a seven-key multisig being equal to roughly 570 bytes. Making an assumption that a block is produced every 20 seconds on average, we can estimate that the multisigs consume almost 900Mb of data per year, which impacts decentralization in a negative way. Large block header size leads to fewer users being incentivized to run light nodes, as well as SPV (simple payment verification) being less accessible, contributing to an inferior overall security.\nSolution: Blockstream's implementation of Schnorr's multisig aggregation on top of the use of ed25519 DSA (digital signature algorithm) can potentially decrease the proof of consensus tenfold.\n\n3. Problem: No fallback mechanism implemented in the consensus protocol means that the consensus has to be hard reset when the nodes cannot reach the consensus.\nSolution: Create a list of standby bookkeepers than can propose a new block after a certain amount of time had expired without the original bookkeeper nodes producing a block (implying the synchronization of the clocks in all nodes to avoid timestamp spoofing).\n\n4. Problem: NEO's overreliance on precise timing. The consensus protocol assumes that the nodes operate with synchronized system clocks, which is only realistic in a centralized environment meaning that the consensus will become error-prone in case multiple nodes (>n/3) have their clocks unsynchronized or drifting.\nSolution: Unfortunately, despite the various proposals, no single solution has proven to be reliable in face of this issue.\n\n5. Problem: Bookkeeper nodes stop trying to reach consensus after the difference between the previous block timestamp and the current time exceeds 10 minutes.\nSolution: The protocol requires a fallback mechanism to ensure that the consensus is never stalled.\n\n6. Problem: This problem is a theoretical possibility, rather than an actual threat to the stability of the platform. Due to the fact that NEO consensus relies on bookkeeper node elections, the core team from NEO are theoretically able to collude with a few large exchanges to elect the majority of the nodes, meaning that the environment will no longer be \"trust-less\". \"Vote rigging\" is what I decided to call this attack vector.\nSolution: KYC-based (know your customer) vote. However, this solution opposes the whole essence of cryptocurrencies and blockchain.",

        "post_body": "**What is Didi Chuxing?**\n\nDidi Chuxing (formerly Didi Kuaidi) is the Uber of China. It was born of a merger between local rivals Didi Dache and Kuaidi Dache in 2015. As a result of the merger, Uber waived the white flag in China and merged their operations with Didi Chuxing in a $35 billion deal. \n\nhttps://venturebeat.com/2016/07/31/uber-reportedly-merges-its-china-operations-with-didi-chuxing-in-35-billion-deal/\n\n**Why is this related to Tron?**\n\nA key Tron backer is Weixing Chen, founder of Kuaidi and famous angel investor. You'll find his profile on the Tron website.\n\nWe\u2019ve already witnessed Singapore\u2019s oBike join the Tron platform. They will create a new coin, oCoin, which will enable their users to earn and pay for bike rentals in Q1 2018. It should also be expected that a second bicycle sharing application eventually joins the Tron network as Wei Dai, founder of Ofo, the biggest shared bicycles provider in China ($3 billion), is also a key investor in Tron.\n\nSo, if two of the largest bicycle-sharing businesses are gravitating to Tron, one can only imagine it won\u2019t take long for the ride-sharing apps to join. If that happens, it will be Didi Chuxing\u2026 who currently handles payment transactions for some 20 million ride orders every day\u2026 mainly through WeChat Pay (Tencent) and Alipay (Alibaba).\n\nInterestingly enough\u2026 less than two weeks ago on December 19th, Didi Chuxing acquired a government license to operate a payment system in China through their purchase of third-party payment-services provider 19Pay for 300 million yuan ($45.4 million).\n\nhttps://www.caixinglobal.com/2017-12-20/didi-chuxing-picks-up-a-payment-license-101187170.html\n\n**So, let\u2019s simplify this correlation for everyone:**\n\nA. Didi Chuxing (the result of a merger between Didi Dache and Kuaidi Dache) is the Uber of China with 20 million ride-share orders per day\n\nB. The founder of Kuaidi, Weixing Chen is a key investor in Tron.\n\nC. Bicycle-sharing company oBike, just announced it will use the Tron network for payments in Q1.\n\nD. Didi Chuxing just acquired a government license in China to operate a payment system.",

The basis for the creation of Bytecoin was the CryptoNote unique technology | https://cryptonote.org/.\n\nFrom this moment on, the official Bytecoin team will be making an effort to be more transparent to the community.\nWe've been following all the activity in the community and we know you've been waiting for us to make a public statement. We see that there are lots of questions and we are now here to answer.\n\nBut firstly let me express my gratitude to all those enthusiasts who have made such valuable contributions to the development of BCN.\nWe are so grateful for all the work put in by @Leogheo and BFB program team, @kinlakinla for the Bytecoin info page, @GaboCarranza and @sydney40 for Bytecointalk activity, @july for the Telegram channel, @boomworking for help with the design and @Camilo_Gil for your sincere appeal to our team.\nThanks to the entire community for your trust and support even when you didn't hear from us. Only with your support  we were able to keep up our strength and continue working.\n\nJust a few words about our history, Bytecoin is the first coin developed under the cryptonote protocol, but due to the fragmented nature of the community, BCN was forked a million times. You know that sometimes we were criticized for \u201cslow development\u201d, but the truth is that when the others were spending time on marketing, we were putting all our effort into enhancing the already existing cryptocurrency ecosystem.\n\nIn any case, we're still here and we're looking to grow. We would like to invite the best cryptographers, developers, bright minds and passionate hearts to join our BCN team to create absolutely new and exciting developments - get ready for the BCN of the new era. To ensure our success in this new era, we'll need to support and trust each other and make our community even stronger.\n\nStarting now, we are open for communication. Feel free to share your thoughts, bugs and features with us. Please send all feedback to contact@bytecoin.org and we'll get back to you asap.\nWe will do our best to bring the best ideas to life.\n\nLet\u2019s start a new chapter of Bytecoin together!",

From my point of view everyone make one huge logic error in reasoning. You compare the Future of NEM with the Present of Etherium. However, the future of the last one is much more exiting.\n\nLet's compare the nearest Protocol of NEM and Etherium: Catapult and Raiden Network.\n\n1. Release date. Both will be released in coming months. No exact date.\n\n2. The testing period. Both are successfully tested by huge banks for more than one year. \n\n3. Open information. Raiden is on github (https://github.com/raiden-network/raiden) and everyone can check progress. The Catapult is secret project and there is no information or roadmap.\n\n4. Scalability, and it is the main point! The Catapult - to 4000 transactions per second. Raiden - to 1000000(!) transactions per second.\n\nMoreover, Raiden is Confidential - transfers don\u2019t show up in the global shared ledger, while NEM is public.\nIn addition, Raiden is made not only for Micropayments, but for IoT as well.\n\nThat's why the price of Etherium grows, so fast. Many investors understand that Raiden will put Ripple and IOTA to scum. \nI am a fan of NEM, I have a few million of xem. However, I am afraid, that the release of Raiden Network will make Nem and Catapult scum too (especially if it will be earlier than Catapult).  No pump, no x2... only dump.\n\nWhat do you think about it? I really want to mistake.\n",

Yes, it's a fork of optimism but people seem to have forgotten that Optimism was actually formed by people who were part of OMG, and was given financial backing by OMG.  Remember the Plasma group?  That was Optimism before they rebranded and changed from a non-profit to a for-profit organization.\n\nhttps://medium.com/plasma-group/ethereum-smart-contracts-in-l2-optimistic-rollup-2c1cef2ec537\n\n> The construction borrows heavily from both plasma and zkRollup designs\n\nAlso, Boba is a fork of Optimism but it's not just a copy and paste.  They have implemented their own ideas from the learnings taken from OMG / Plasma.  One of the key differences is \"Turing\" on Boba.\n\nhttps://docs.boba.network/turing\n\nI've been happily staking, providing liquidity etc on Boba for some months now and earning some nice yields.  Yes, it's not as popular as Arbitum/Optimism but do people really think there is only room for one or two L2s in Eth's future?\n\nIgnore the haters, do your own research.  They have some sweet incentives running at the moment, currently on round three, in this bear market with yields in Defi getting crushed elsewhere, I'm not complaining....

        "post_body": "A new age of community participation is about to start on the IOTA network. A decision has to be made about what will happen to a total of about 60 Terra-IOTA (= 60,000,000 MIOTA, currently worth around 50 million USD) that lie dormant on the IOTA 1.0 network. This decision will be made by YOU and the rest of the IOTA community. All token holders will be able to vote for this important decision directly inside their Firefly wallets. The two options are:\n\na) BUILD with these tokens (spend them on community projects)\n\nb) BURN those tokens (lock them away so nobody will ever be able to use them)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Where do these 60 Ti come from?**\n\nMost of the tokens at stake were sold at IOTAs original crowd-sale in 2016, but were never claimed by their respective buyers. Others remain unclaimed since a network-transition in the beginnings of 2017. After five years of trying to find the owners the IOTA Foundation gave out a final deadline to claim these tokens, pledging to give the remaining ones into the hands of the IOTA community. This deadline passed and now it is onto you to decide about their future.\n\n**Who can vote?**\n\nAll IOTA token holders!\n\nYour voting weight will be determined by two factors:\n\n1. How many tokens do you use for this vote (100 MIOTA have 10-times more voting power than 10 MIOTA)\n2. How long do you not move your tokens during the voting period (probably about two weeks). Lower holding times will result in proportionally lower voting weight (for example, if two weeks will be defined as 100% voting weight, then holding them still for one week will result in 50% of voting weight).\n\n**!!Important!!**\n\n\u00b7 Voting is completely **for free** (no costs, no fees)\n\n\u00b7 Voting is completely **voluntary** (you will neither directly gain or lose anything by casting your vote).\n\n\u00b7 You will have **100% control of your tokens at all times** (tokens stay at your address)\n\n\u00b7 Your **tokens do not get locked** in this process (you can use them for something else at any time)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**How do I vote?**\n\nYou will be able to vote with your tokens **directly inside your official Firefly wallet** (supporting version will be released before the election, expected later this year). This version will have a completely new voting window with a clean design and a clear and easy user-interface (see mock-up pictures below as an example).\n\nIn case you vote, Firefly will send your tokens to your own address (this means they effectively don\u2019t move and they never leave your control). This transaction will carry your decision as a data-load. Your decision as well as your voting weight will be fully transparent on the IOTA Tangle. As every transaction on IOTA **your vote will be pseudonymous** (the address will be public, however your name or other personal information will never enter the network in any way).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The options: Build or Burn!**\n\n**Option A: BUILD**\n\nIf the majority of tokens votes for \u201cbuild\u201d, a decentralized form of organization (for example a DAO) will be set up by community members in order control these 60 Ti. This organization will be fully controlled by the IOTA community via token-weighted democracy or another system, that the community decides on. IOTA-focused projects that want to receive funds could be able to apply for payments according to rules that will be created and voted on by the community. Community-vote will always decide, if these funds are paid out.\n\nThis organization would be built under **democratic supervision** of the community: Important decisions will be up for vote about every 4-6 weeks within your Firefly wallet (participation is of course voluntary).\n\n**Option B: BURN**\n\nIf the majority of tokens vote to \u201cburn\u201d, no DAO will be build and instead all tokens in question will remain unmigrated into the current IOTA 1.5 (Chrysalis) network. This will irreversibly lock these tokens away, prohibiting anyone from ever using them again for any purpose.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Preliminary design of the new voting-windows in Firefly**\n\n**Vote proposal window**\n\nInside your voting menu you can see all ongoing votes regarding the IOTA treasury DAO. At the beginning you will only find the \"build or burn\" vote.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p8yrkj1uqvj71.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9e775be9582af1c640442e3d563beed66d1a5a7\n\n**Proposal details**\n\nIn the details page of any proposal you can find all important information about the vote that is to be decided on, including the exact meaning of both voting options. Here you will also find the buttons enabling you to cast your vote\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7jjcg5fvqvj71.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=29d51374659ee9624c2e65a1055a7df7e235aa0d\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Join the community efforts now!**\n\nThe IOTA treasury governance is a real grassroots development and thrives from community participation. This project needs developers, communicators as well as enthusiasts and people with ideas! Get active today by following the project or reaching out to the currently active developers on:\n\nIOTA Discord -  #governance channel\n\nWebsite: [www.iotatreasury.org](http://www.iota-treasury.org/) (under construction)\n\nI hope you enjoy the cause and for everone else: Happy voting (later this year)!",

Particularly love that part:\n\n>>**Bitcoin and the Blocksize debate**\n\n>>In the last few weeks, a debate has been raging across all Bitcoin discussion forums on whether or not to increase Bitcoin\u2019s block size limit. Actually the debate has been going on for longer than that but the rate and temperature of discussion have been greatly increased more recently.\n\n>>For the Bitcoin project, both sides are correct in their assumption that the blocksize issue is a real problem. However, they\u2019re stuck in between a rock and a hard place. If they increase the blocksize, they will risk losing more full nodes due to the cost of operating a node, which in turn makes the network less robust and prone to DDOS attacks and other issues. If they don\u2019t increase the blocksize, the network will become increasingly more expensive to send money on and naturally competitors will begin to look more attractive to the general public.\n\n>>As for our position in this debate, we\u2019re not in any immediate danger and have a plan for how to deal with this issue when it comes up. In fact we\u2019re already planning the tools for how we will support a massive amount of transactions. What if we kept the blocksize limit at 1MB and had a great wallet for general users that used off-chain transactions the majority of the time? As a result we would have a small blockchain, low fees and nearly limitless transaction support. The goal is to stay lean and allow for growth at the same time."

Every project has its naysayers, but if the underlying team and concept is strong, it doesn't matter. The idea behind QTUM is very strong and easy to understand for non-technical people. It takes the best of bitcoin and ethereum, keeps compatibility, melds them together, and makes key improvements. You can even leverage ongoing improvements in both of those existing projects as they happen and adapt for your project. That's great and its a winning formula. It's easy to sell this concept. But to be successful, the team leads need to be out front showing continuous presence and control. \n\nQTUM leads need to take this post to heart:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Qtum/comments/70kayx/so_these_guys_release_their_mainnet_on_the_13th/\n\nBottom line: You guys need better communication. \nI know you don't have a giant team, but this isn't that hard and it isn't rocket science. It's basic discipline. You need one of the project leads (not a mod) to post and answer \"burning\" questions every day or every couple of days, directly. Even better, roll up the answers to the biggest concerns/questions and post on twitter or another official source (once again daily or every couple of days). A reddit sticky works as well, but its not as high profile. This is not a job for a mod, it is a job for a project lead with direct knowledge of and involvement in day to day activity. Good discipline demands you communicate EVEN IF YOU HAVE NOTHING NEW. Always communicate.\n\nIF THERE IS A PROBLEM, PEOPLE CAN LIVE WITH IT IF YOU COMMUNICATE PROMPTLY, OFTEN AND WELL through official channels (i.e. not relegated to slack or whatever you move to). Please fix/improve your communication. You are hurting yourself and your investors. ",

        "post_title": "An open letter to the core team",
        "post_body": "Dear Core team,\n\nI am writing this open letter after observing what I consider to be flagrant examples of conflict of interest on behalf of Diego \u201crehrar\u201d Salazar, Monero\u2019s only salaried employee and the founder of CypherStack. I am writing in a personal capacity and not as a representative of any workgroup or as a spokesperson for anyone else. Hopefully, this letter induces others to voice their opinion on the subject, whether positive or negative, so that you may determine if the status quo should remain or if change is needed.\n\nThe most recent example was the [proposed](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/nxkyoi/update_on_triptych_multisig_proposal/), and later [scrapped](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/nxkyoi/update_on_triptych_multisig_proposal/h1kn4ml?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), plan for CypherStack to open a second funding proposal to make up for exchange rate fluctuations on their original proposal. I hope you followed that discussion in its entirety and read the many opinions that were voiced therein. This request seemed to rub many the wrong way, not because of the small shortfall of a few XMR, but because of the insinuation that further research work by a valued contributor who now works under CypherStack would be withheld in the future if that demand were not met. The Monero project attracts the sort of people who do not take well to ultimatums and this latest episode made evident that many would accept the loss of any individual contributor if the alternative meant bowing to the demands of some corporate entity.\n\nIn addition to (recently) founding CypherStack, Diego has been working for you as Monero\u2019s only salaried employee since 2017. When it was [revealed in 2019](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/hjixed/general_fund_transparency_report_2019_june_2020/) that this arrangement had been going on for two and a half years, many people in the community felt that their trust had been betrayed and I shared their feelings. Our rainy-day fund had been severely depleted. I have not felt comfortable donating to the General Fund since. We asked for details about Diego\u2019s role and the work he was performing for you but did not receive a satisfactory response. Diego put out a [transparency report](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/iteivi/rehrar_transparency_report/), which was not received warmly. He had also committed to putting out a [monthly report](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/i8hbr8/monero_community_workgroup_is_preparing_for_the/g1nq8sa?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) about the work he was doing. No such reports followed.\n\nThe existence of a single, salaried employee within the ranks of hundreds of unpaid volunteers (and a few paid ones who regularly must ask for donations and do not have the safety of a stable, dollar-denominated income) ruffled some feathers, but people generally got over it and work continued unabated. I rationalized it by thinking that having a talented contributor who is engaged with Monero on a full-time basis was a win for the project and that the initial lack of communication could be overcome. I was not unwittingly contributing to his salary anymore so what did it bother me? And it did not, until Diego\u2019s many other engagements began to represent what I consider to be a conflict of interest and a liability to the project.\n\nMy specific complaints:\n\n* Diego was one of the 3 people who formed the ill-fated [Monero Community Workgroup, LLC](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/i8hbr8/monero_community_workgroup_is_preparing_for_the/), which was seen by many as an attempt to put the work of numerous unpaid volunteers under private ownership, although he did [back out of it](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/i9qc74/rehrar_clarification_on_the_llc/) as soon as he felt which way the wind was blowing. As a result, the other 2 people involved relinquished control over the workgroup and handed it to Core, which in effect meant handing it to Diego, since he administers the group as part of his responsibilities for Core. In short, Diego\u2019s position only improved as a result of this debacle.\n* He provides paid services to other participants in the Monero ecosystem (e.g., his work for[Local Monero](https://localmonero.co/knowledge?language=en)) while simultaneously receiving payment from the public coffers. This is akin to working in the public and private sectors simultaneously and can be seen as trading on influence. This also means that Diego now has a financial interest in keeping Local Monero (or any of his other clients) in Core\u2019s good graces. This could easily evolve into people hiring Diego to curry favor with Core for one reason or another. While Core members have (and have had) businesses in the Monero ecosystem, which necessitates some level of financial interaction with various ecosystem participants, this is arguably OK because Core members are unpaid volunteers. I would hold an employee paid by community funds to a higher standard.\n* He works for competing projects. An example is the [Firo rebrand](https://twitter.com/firoorg/status/1324430879226167296?s=20). I do not have to explain why this is disagreeable.\n* By leveraging his position with the core team, Diego has successfully attracted long-time contributors to his outsourcing enterprise, CypherStack, and is hiring them back out to the Monero community at a profit. While producing the benefit of bringing those contributors back to Monero, it is another example of Diego profiting off Monero and trading on the influence afforded to him by his position with Core. [Non-profit options were offered to him](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/nxkyoi/update_on_triptych_multisig_proposal/h1karq2?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and rejected. ([I voiced my concerns](https://monerologs.net/monero-community/20210408#c224632) immediately upon that announcement and was informed that [Core was briefed](https://monerologs.net/monero-community/20210409#c224758) and was OK with this arrangement. I had a [separate discussion](https://libera.monerologs.net/monero-community/20210612#c587) with Diego on IRC after his most recent request.)\n* Through CypherStack, he lends the same valued Monero contributors to competing projects, [namely Firo](https://firo.org/2021/04/10/research-acceleration.html). The leader of that project then publicly bragged about poaching a particular contributor from Monero and used it as an example of why his project is superior to Monero. In this way, CypherStack inflicted reputational damage to Monero.\n* In connection with the above, while formulating his [first funding proposal](https://repo.getmonero.org/monero-project/ccs-proposals/-/merge_requests/222) to the Monero community, Diego neglected to mention that he already had a full-time agreement for the same contractor with Firo and only [added a vague note about this small detail](https://repo.getmonero.org/monero-project/ccs-proposals/-/merge_requests/222/diffs?commit_id=ab51373fa1f65c79bd034b59c2cd2ea754c23659) two days before the CCS was merged and after all the discussion had been had. Monero did not receive the option of hiring that contributor on a full-time basis, despite the existing desire and ability to pay for full-time work, and settled for second place. This shows that CypherStack\u2019s priorities (and by extension, Diego\u2019s) do not lie with the Monero project.\n* CypherStack falsely advertised itself as the solution to volatility for erstwhile contributors while lacking sufficient reserves or mechanisms to provide it. This became evident when a $2000 shortfall caused by predictable factors resulted in threats to \u201c[pause XMR research work](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/nxkyoi/update_on_triptych_multisig_proposal/h1itrfx?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\u201d.\n\nIn short, while Diego has shown himself to be a talented contributor and a maybe even more talented entrepreneur, his priorities are not fully aligned with those of the Monero project. I want to encourage the Core team to help Diego decide whether he wants to be an employee of Monero or whether he wants to provide services to the Monero project (and any other projects and companies he wishes) as an independent contributor/volunteer, just like everyone else. I would personally prefer the second option.\n\nIf Diego is unable to fulfill the role of a Core employee who puts the community\u2019s interests before his own and refrains from lending himself and others out to any bidder that comes along, then I would urge the core team to find someone who is willing to serve solely in that capacity. It would be appreciated if that selection process were done openly and funding be completed through the CCS, even if Core chooses to guarantee any shortfall through the General Fund. It is also worth noting that there are plenty of talented people within the community who would likely perform the work for little or no pay, because they [actually hold XMR](https://youtu.be/9PZkIteyyTM?t=2690) and the project\u2019s success is aligned with their personal success.\n\nWhoever is to serve in a role that is funded by community donations should be subject to the standards and practices of the CCS and produce monthly or bi-monthly reports about their work.  When I recently asked Diego about his missing reports again, he said that he is accountable only to Core and that no future reports will be made because they are [a waste of his time](https://youtu.be/9PZkIteyyTM?t=1809). I sincerely hope that the core team does not regard its responsibilities to the community in the same way.\n\nYours,\n\ngeonic\n\n\\-------------------\n\nedit: so far, Diego has chosen to respond and answer the community's questions on IRC.

I also believe one of the botnet is operated by North Korean government to go past the embargo. They have capable staff who've demonstrated similar capability in the past. The NK government needs cash and they will sell their mined XMR for any price. I think my monero wallet will decrease in value.\n\nNow it seems devs and most people in this sub don't think it's the case, it's just my personal opinion of how things are going on. Look into /r/moneromining and nobody believes it's worth mining monero anymore. Very different sentiment from /r/ethermining or other subs where miners are still bullish and support the coin.\n\nI'll track progress and if it looks like things are in control, I'll get back to monero.

        "post_body": "Dear NEO Community:\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFirst of all, we would like to express our gratitude to all of you who are active in the community for your continuous supports and contributions. NEO, as an open-source project has witnessed sound development since it was initiated in 2014.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nNEO specializes in the underlying technology of blockchain and aims to build an open network utilizing digital assets, digital identities and smart contracts to serve the smart economy in the future. dBFT Consensus Mechanism, NeoContract Smart Contract System and NeoX Cross-chain Protocol were all originally developed by NEO, a tech-savvy community that specializes in core technologies of blockchain.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBack to a year ago, NEO completed its refundable ICO, the first ever in token-raising history, where about half of the participants were from outside of China. From Sept. 7, 2016 when the ICO took place, to Oct. 17, 2016 when NEO\u2019s mainnet was launched, all participants were at liberty to demand full refund. Over the said period, there were 15 refund requests executed, amounting to a total of 50.308364 BTC. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nSuch refundable scheme had never been practiced before and has proved to protect the right of ICO participants effectively.\nWith growth of the community, NEO has expanded from a China-based open-source project to a renowned and world-leading public blockchain supported by communities and developers from all around the world. Today, NEO Council has obtained sufficient resources to support its technological R&D and ecosystem development for the next few years. In light of the ever more explicit ICO regulation requirements released globally, we decide to extend the refund option. Those who participated in seed-round financing, ICO1 and ICO2 may contact contact@neo.org prior to Oct. 17, 2017 to be fully refunded after sending back all NEO tokens obtained from ICO.\nSince 2016 ICO, we have made it clear that NEO is a not-for-profit open-source project driven and funded by the community. Apart from our continuous efforts in product delivering and ecosystem developing, we also seek to contribute back to the community in other ways. Therefore, we will offer pro rata incentives to seed-round financing, ICO1 and ICO2 participants who decided not to execute their refund options. Detailed plan will be released later.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIn addition, NEO Council is making strenuous efforts in prompting NEO\u2019s sustainable development under existing laws and regulations. In Q4 2017, NEO will work with international legal advisors to establish a legal framework which is compliant in major countries for smart contracts running on top of NEO to adopt.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nCompliance is inevitable after the blockchain industry matures to a certain stage. From the very beginning, we decided to be compliant with laws and regulations in terms of the choices of design philosophy, consensus mechanism and governing model. These choices made us well-prepared for challenges and opportunities waiting ahead. NEO community is looking forward to your active engagement and valuable advices. We would like to express our gratitude again for your company and support throughout the journey!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nNEO Council\n\n\nSeptember 5, 2017",

NEO is just 40x in advance against Ethereum, when I see neotracker.io for example, the system of Gas or ICOs that will be in the next months?\nEthereum has unfortunately became a garbage of useless ICO and scammers.\n\n\n*\n\n**Edit:** Due to number of comments I have to explain a little more my decision. By meaning garbage of useless ICO, I mean that only 1% of ERC20-based are real projects. If you are old in this game, just remember the GNO disaster, just look at the [richest token page](https://etherscan.io/tokenrichlist), who can prove that a manipulation is not possible? Why GNO team has more than $1,5B of their token? I mean it's like 95%. They can withdraw them on 200 days. And the market cap will be $1,5B? No of all. GNO will crash instantly, ETH and others will follow. People (and me) have used ICO too much and the system is done. Just look at District0x or BlockCat, and their cap in comparison with June with Status or Bancor (btw, I think I will never understand why a team will $150M to build a website or a single iphone app, but pass). \n\nAnother example, [EOS and their fucking infinity ICO](https://eosscan.io/), why the fuck do you explain that they have right now 1,1M ETH (and it's still running), why don't you think that they can cash out all of them one day? (because they do it each day) They don't even have a fucking product. It's just advertising, now you have put 1% of total ETH on greedy hands. I am sorry but I will never feel more as confiant as at the beginning on the Ethereum system.\n\nSo, okay, Ethereum has EEA and many future, but I feel more confiant about NEO's future with China and regulation, than all of this world of scammers/stealers on the Ethereum blockchain (that don't mean that NEO is safe, but for now, it is). \n\n\n**That's not the technology behind Ethereum that I critic, but the use that have been made during the past year. I explain my worry about what some greedy team behind huge ICO can do with *our* ETH.**\n\nNEO has still a lot to prove for all of us, and this is a **real working product**. \n\n*\n\nI was a proud hodler of Ethereum since feb 2016, now I have converted all of them and I have to say that I am full-NEO. The next Ethereum. The 2.0.\n\nSorry about grammar",

        "post_body": "I created this post as I cannot answer everybody via private message. The whole stir that you can observe for the last 24 hours was caused by misinformation of RedPulse Token being banned in China. Nothing could be further from the truth, as no government intervention was carried out. It was the developers who decided to secure themselves and the business long-term, as the new regulations won't be ready before 10th of September. Transparency, legal cooperation, government certificates and permits are at the core of the Smart Economy. It must be this way if you want to see the mass adoption of smart contracts in any country. Let me quote the Red Pulse's white paper and Da Hongfei's words:\n\n\"Developers of Bitcoin and Ethereum have highlighted anonymity as one of their platforms\u2019 main features. However, this comes with an inherent disadvantage, which is the integrity of transactions. NEO addresses this by adding digital identity to its capabilities.\n\nWith its origins in China, observers believe that this particular feature is beneficial in wider adoption of the technology in the country. Moreover, NEO is said to have the support of regulatory agencies and the business community in general. Beyond China, the main potential is in how NEO can better integrate with real-world applications, particularly those that require confirmation of identity, such as smart contracts.\n\n\u201cNEO aims to integrate itself better with the real economy. Only with the introduction of digital identity can we map offchain assets in a complaint manner\"\n\n\"Cryptocurrencies have been viewed as operating in a regulatory grey area in China. Recent developments are promising however. The People\u2019s Bank of China (PBoC), China\u2019s central bank as well as financial regulator, has been actively engaged in the blockchain and cryptocurrency space since 2014. PBoC also launched its own fintech committee in May 2017 to study the impact of cryptocurrency on monetary policies, financial stability, settlement and clearing, among others.\nIn July 2017, a consortium of six Chinese blockchain institutes jointly released a document titled \u201cGuiyang Initial Coin Offering (ICO) Consensus\u201d in Guiyang city [18]. The document outlines a plan to self-regulate initial coin offerings in China and prevent the outbreak of systemic financial risks. The proposal includes a pre-approval system for ICO applicants, clear investor requirements, and marketing and publicity rules. Red Pulse intends to comply with these directives, as appropriate and within our capabilities.\"\n\nSumming up. The whole situation is used to shake off the weak hands and stocking up cheap coins before the First ICO is released. All people that invested in Antshares definitely realized the goverment cooperation, they understood Chinese market potential and difficulties. Furthermore, that was the main reason they invested. You already have the pioneering smart contract network- Ethereum. What differentiates ether from neo and onchain is the business plan to implement it in the real world economies. While ethereum foundation ran away from responsibility to Switzerland, the guys on NEO and Onchain are legally operating at the biggest, fastest growing, and over-regulated market in the world. Kudos to them. Everone who knows at least a bit about China would understand that the Ethereum Foundation, having hundreds of ICOs (Dog Coins, Useless Ethereum Coin and dozens of other ponzi schemes) that are totally unregulated, does not stand a chance on Chinese market.\n\nLast, but not least. I do not advise anyone to invest in anything, just wanted to clarify some things so you can see the whole picture. Please remember that buying technological coins like NEO, you invest in technology. But the best technology can be worthless without mass market adoption. And this means fulfilling the plethora of legal restrictions, regulations and certificates. Looking at the ICOs history on ether smart contract network, or bitprotocol scam copies, one may be thankful for Onchain and NEO devs. Finally, we have the right, humble, hard working people at the right place, who understand the current limitations of blockchain.\n\nDisclaimer:\nI'm an early investor in NEO network, so the opinion might be biased. If you disagree with my logic, do not invest your money. Especially more than you are ready to lose. People ask me in private messages who I am and what I do for a living and if I have experience with crypto. Well, I'm unemployed, no-experience teenager wanting to pump the coin. No, wait. I'm a billionaire in store of value in BTC who invested in 2011 and just getting bored during summer in Taipei to give some advise out of good heart I have. Oh wait, I'm a... I think since you cannot verify anything about people writing on reddit under their nicks, use your own logic. Critical thinking and cold analysis never hurts. Especially in the era of investors looking for information from YouTube gurus, who started investing on the market 6 months ago, and posting moon prices on their videos. Be smarter.\n\n\nBest Regards.\n\n",

I'm one of the \"crypto\" guys in my community and have often been asked about Bitcoin - people have began asking me more about Ripple recently which is fascinating. Some of these traditional investors are very comfortable  and attracted to the idea of investing in XRP long term vs. Bitcoin. They really like that Ripple/XRP has a strong use case and potential to add major value to the financial system accompanied with the fact that it's being directed by super talented team of individuals. Nothing against Bitcoin at all but it's interesting to see Ripple start to click in peoples heads while they still struggle to understand the role Bitcoin plays in the future. ",

I believe the true goal of Bitcoin Private is to compete with and outpace the ZCash project, and to provide a privacy coin without a founder's tax applied on mining rewards. We should instead utilize this subreddit to provide valuable feedback to the developers on areas they can improve, and contribute our own ideas on how we can expand our reach as a community, doing this would attract many more exchanges to our coin and would be much more effective than spamming every exchange's twitter account.",

Central banks think it's super uncool to have to deal with USD Gold, USD Cash, and so forth. So we can likely exclude all DLT's that don't have the possibility of **issuer enforced finality.**  A large win for Stellar\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Interoperability**\n\nStellar makes it very easy to create, send and trade digital representations of all forms of money and convert between them on a single network, this will eventually be the way to convert money and all kinds of assets currency, stocks, gold, and so forth.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Public and non-profit**\n\nIf you think Central Banks are going to issue their CBDC's where the foundation taking care of the network is for profit, think again. Here again Stellar aim for the stars and hits. I'd count many of the for profit initiatives as unlikely to get any CBCD's released on them\n\n>'Stellar has no owner; if anything it\u2019s owned by the public. The software runs across a decentralized, open network ...'\n\n[https://www.stellar.org/learn/intro-to-stellar](https://www.stellar.org/learn/intro-to-stellar)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>\u201cI left Ripple in 2013. They didn\u2019t take it into the right direction. What we wanted to improve is the way that the tokens are distributed. They also set it up as a for profit company. Can you imagine the internet as a for profit? it\u2019s a mistake. So, Stellar was set up as a nonprofit...\"\n\nJed McCaleb\n\n[https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/stellar-ceo-want-real-enough-dot-com-bubble-pops/](https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/stellar-ceo-want-real-enough-dot-com-bubble-pops/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Extremely cheap, fast transfer costs and scale**\n\nWith bitcoin transactions costing an arm and a leg, Stellar shines like starlight yet again.\n\nEven if xlm is to go up to 15USD which I think it will over the next 4-5 years. Given it gets 5-6 CBDC's on the network in that time. The transaction cost will still be close to nothing. And with price surging we have a solution to 'spam' on the networks. It already handles millions of transactions/operations each day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Massive CDBC' Market & Metcalfes law**\n\nSeveral countries are starting to move into or seriously consider CBDC's, and this will make the network extremely valuable over time. Not valuable because it's valuable, but valuable because it is extremely useful to people. Usefulness comes first and then value, and value and price are not the same. This is very easy to forget in todays crypto market.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>\u201cStellar is an open protocol for payments. If there\u2019s a digital dollar, there needs to be a real one somewhere. That\u2019s what Stellar does. We have a Stellar consensus protocol. BTC uses proof of work. It\u2019s an extremely expensive process. We have a way more efficient system. Not everybody has to agree on who you trust on the network.>>The creators of the internet didn\u2019t predict Wikipedia or airBNB. And that\u2019s what we are. We\u2019re a platform that allows a lot of creativity and enormous opportunities.\u201d\n\n*Jed McCaleb*\n\n[https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/stellar-ceo-want-real-enough-dot-com-bubble-pops/](https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/stellar-ceo-want-real-enough-dot-com-bubble-pops/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Energi Efficiency**\n\nIn the world many people and governments are concerned with energy usage, and since Stellar is not a proof of work network, it is much, much more energy efficient. This matters and is likely to matter even more in the future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>\u201cBut software is iterative and can always be improved. One of the things that bothered me about Bitcoin is the mining aspect. There are literally billions of dollars spent on mining which is a shame. I thought if there is another way we can solve the consensus problem, then we should explore it. So with Ripple and now Stellar, this is a way to solve consensus without the proof-of-work mining process so transactions can be sent in a much cheaper, faster, more energy-efficient way.\"\n\nJed McCaleb\n\n[https://bravenewcoin.com/insights/podcasts/connect-the-world-how-stellar-is-connecting-the-global-financial-system](https://bravenewcoin.com/insights/podcasts/connect-the-world-how-stellar-is-connecting-the-global-financial-system)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUkraine:\n\n[https://stellar.org/press-releases/ukrainian-ministry-of-digital-transformation-to-develop-virtual-assets-and-to-facilitate-cbdc-infrastructure-with-the-stellar-development-foundation](https://stellar.org/press-releases/ukrainian-ministry-of-digital-transformation-to-develop-virtual-assets-and-to-facilitate-cbdc-infrastructure-with-the-stellar-development-foundation)\n\nSweden:\n\nTheir e-currency pilot project is completing February this year.

        "post_body": "Just thinking aloud here.  \n\n\n\nTo begin with, I am NOT worried about the current XRP value dip.   As I mentioned in my previous [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ripple/comments/8q7w7z/imho_xrp_price_is_totally_irrelevant_until_real/), I think the current XRP value is purely speculative, so I'm NOT worried about that. I'm just waiting for when the current dip reverses, and then I'll buy some more XRP on it's way up.  \n\n\nHaving that said, I AM a bit worried. Because the way I see it, the future is looking very bright for Rapid and XRP. Almost TOO bright. So I MUST be missing something. Because when things look too good to be true, they probably are. So in the back of my head I'm thinking, what am I missing? What could go wrong?  \n\n\nCould Ripple fail catastrophically due to some unforeseen upcoming regulations? Could a potential SEC ruling of XRP being a security void the usage of XRP as a utility token? Something like that? I'm trying to see the grim alternatives here. But it is difficult, as we in the Ripple community are kind of echo chamber positive about XRP. So I'm trying to see beyond that..  \n\n\nSo I was thinking.. maybe we all could put our critical thinking caps on, and try to envision what setbacks could arise ahead, and then, for each of them, discuss the probabilities of them happening, and their consequences. I think it would be sane, to have that kind of constructive criticism discussion.",

        "post_body": "First of all forgive me if there are any grammer or whatever mistakes, I`m not a native speaker. I just made my first account on Reddit some minutes ago, being a silent reader since I jumped on the market in July 2017. So yeah, for me it\u00b4s a serious call if I am doing that step\u2026\n\nI truly want to open up a conversation to the PR and information system about IOTA. It hurts me. It annoys me. It seriously makes me angry. I feel there is many people out there thinking the same, when they see another bad Twitter feed by David. This twitter response by David seriously made me so sad man and it has to stop. \n\nWe are talking about this: https://twitter.com/DavidSonstebo/status/949068287383691265\n\nSomething personal: IOTA was my first investment and still has the biggest stack in my portfolio. It\u2019s the coin I was/am most interested in, the technique is its own kind, the system is brilliant, everything about it is fantastic. Yes there is still a huge deficit in the usecase, the wallets and so on, but serious talk guys, the team will fix it. I don\u2019t care about the price at the market, I don\u2019t care about all these moon comments, I don\u2019t care about FOMO and FUD. The market will realize its potential in some years, as long as the team does their job. And still, there is always two sides on a company.\n\nI\u2019ve been working for five years in a company. I loved my job, my salary was fantastic, my colleagues were great. Still there were these two directors making me crazy with unemotional acting and sometimes hurting comments. It was not only about me, all of my team had problems even though we all liked each other. After two years of my departure (and yes I stopped working for them because of those 2 dickheads) the 100man company got shutdown by exactly that fact. The directors destroyed the whole company making bad calls for the company and their colleagues. And you know what the real problem is? They would have never_admit_any_mistakes and would not have changed anything! I think I am not the only one who had/has a bad director, guess people in this thread can feel the same. \n\nWhy am I writing this little story of my life. David, that\u2019s for you, you are going straight in this direction. Even though you might do fantastic work on the techniqual side, you have to realize that you do destroy the trust of your true fellows. Step down from PR stuff, hand it over to professionals, get your marketing fixed and work in the background. Admit you have done wrong comments in the past (you can do it silently to yourself, no1 cares) and change yourself! There is a limit of trust people are putting in your company and mine is not far away from cutting this project because of you. Yes I am a simple man with a small M4digit number into your market \u2013 still, if one starts there is always people to follow. This is not a threat or anything because even now you still can say \u201cI don\u2019t care\u201d \u2013 but hey, we are the one spreading the word into our families, to our friends, to our trading bros. There is a golden rule in life of marketing: Piss of one guy and lose another ten customers \u2013 make one guy happy and gain another one. And yet silence is sometimes a better tool than anything you could\u2019ve ever said. \n\n I can live with the fact this post might get downvoted to hell. This is my one and only statement I will do about these incidents. I truly hope there will be a change in the future and David will read this and think about it. Feel free to write any comments here, would be happy to hear if I\u00b4m overreacting on this thing or if you feel the same. \n\nIf you buy a product, you buy a feeling as well. Never forget that.\n\n\n//e: my short response is below Davids text! :)",

It seems to me that a lot of the criticism about the IOTA founder communication stems from misunderstandings about the major differences between real life and a social media platform. If you look at IOTA in a context outside of the crypto space it is insane how much you have achieved in such a small timeframe. If you were a stock everybody would lose their minds in regards to your potential. Soon, all of this nonsensical - and to be frank, uninteresting criticism of the way you communicate be completely disregarded. Nobody who matters truly will care."

        "post_body": "**Last updated: May 30, 2018: Updated wallet info with release of Trinity.\n\nThis 4 part series from the IOTA foundation covers most of the technical FUD centered at IOTA. \n\nhttps://blog.iota.org/official-iota-foundation-response-to-the-digital-currency-initiative-at-the-mit-media-lab-part-1-72434583a2\n\nAlso the [official IOTA faq](https://www.iota.org/get-started/faqs) on iota.org answers nearly all of these questions if you want to hear the answers directly.\n\n**Purpose of Writing**\n\nSince posting FUD is so ridiculously low-effort in comparison to setting the record straight, I felt it necessary to put a log of copy-pastas together to balance the scales so its just as easy to answer the FUD as it was to generate it. So next time you hear someone say \"IOTA is centralized\", you no longer have to take an hour out of your day and spin your wheels with someone who likely had an agenda to begin with. You just copy-paste away and move on. \n\nIt's also worth mentioning IOTA devs are too damn busy working on the protocol and doing their job to answer FUD. So I felt a semblance of responsibility.\n\nHere they are. These answers are too my understanding so if you see something that doesn't look right let me know! They are divided into the following categories so if you are interested in a specific aspect of IOTA you can scroll to that section.\n\n1) WALLET\n\n2) COMMUNITY\n\n3) INVESTING\n\n4) TECHNICAL\n\n**************\n\n#WALLET\n\n##IOTA was hacked and users funds were stolen!\n\nFirst, IOTA was not hacked. The term \u201chacked\u201d is thrown around way too brazingly nowadays and often used to describe events that weren\u2019t hacks to begin with. Its a symptom of this space growing way too fast creating situations of the blind leading the blind and causing hysteria. \n\nWhat happened: \n\nMany IOTA users trusted a certain 3rd party website to create their seed for their wallets. This website silently sent copies of all the seeds generated to an email address and waited till it felt it had enough funds, then it took everyones money simultaneously. That was the \u201dhack\u201d. \n\nhttps://blog.iota.org/the-secret-to-security-is-secrecy-d32b5b7f25ef\n\nThe lesson: \n\nThe absolute #1 marketed feature of crypto is that  **you are your own bank**. Of everything that is common knowledge about crypto, this is at the top. But being your own bank means you are responsible for the security of your own funds. There is no safety net or centralized system in place that is going to bail you out. \n\nFor those that don\u2019t know (and you really should if you\u2019ve invested in anything crypto), your seed is your username-pw-security question-backup email all rolled into one. Would you trust a no-name 3rd party website to produce your username+pw for your bank account? Because thats essentially what users did.\n\nThe fix:\n\nMake your seed offline with the generators in the sidebar or use dice. This is outlined in the \u201chow to generate wallet and seed\u201d directly following. \n\nThe trinity and carriota wallets will have seed generators within them upon their release.\n\n##How to generate wallet and seed\n\n1) Download official trinity wallet [here](https://trinity.iota.org/)\n\n2) follow the instructions on the app. \n\n3) Do not run any apps in conjunction with the trinity app. Make sure all other apps are completely closed out on your device. \n\n##Are you sure a computer can\u2019t just guess my seed?\n\nAn IOTA seed is 81 characters long. There are more IOTA seed combinations than atoms in the universe. All the computers in the world combined would take ~~millions~~ billions of years just to find your randomly generated one that\u2019s located somewhere between the 0th and the 27^81st combination. The chance for someone to randomly generate the exact same seed as yours is 1 / (27^81). \n\nIf you can\u2019t fathom the number 27 ^ 81, this video should help:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8YIdmwcubc\n\n##Why is Trinity wallet taking so long!!??\n\nTrinity is out. https://trinity.iota.org/\n\n**************\n\n#COMMUNITY\n\n##IOTA introduction video to share with family\n\nhttps://youtu.be/LyC04NrJ3yA\n\n##Tangle visualizers\n\n\nhttp://tangle.glumb.de/\n\n##How to setup a full node\n\nDownload Bolero and run! Bolero is an all-in-one full node install package with the latest IOTA IRI and Nelson all under a one-click install! \n\nhttps://github.com/SemkoDev/bolero.fun/releases\n\n\"If you want to help the network then spam the network. If you **really** want to help the network then create a full node and let others spam you!\" \n\n##No questions or concerns get upvoted, only downvoted!\n\nThat\u2019s just the nature of this business. Everyone in these communities has money at stake and are extremely incentivized to keep only positive news at the top of the front page. There is nothing you're going to do about that on this subreddit or any crypto subreddit. It's just a reddit fact of life we have to deal with. Everyone has a downvote and everyone has an upvote. But what can be done is just simply answer the questions even if they are downvoted to hell. Yea most people wont' see the answers or discussion but that one person will. every little bit counts.\n\nI will say that there are most certainly answers to nearly every FUD topic out there. Every single one. A lot of the posts I'm seeing as of late especially since the price spike are rehashed from months ago. They are often not answered not because there isn't an answer/explanation, but because regulars who have the answers simply don't see them (for the reason listed above). I can see how it's easy for this to be interpreted (especially by new users) as there not being an answer or \"the FUDsters are on to something\" but thats just not the case.\n\n##Developer's candidness (aka dev's are assholes!) \n\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/Iota/comments/7obyyx/serious_talk_about_pr_system_iota_and_david/ds8ouvc\n\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/Iota/comments/7obyyx/serious_talk_about_pr_system_iota_and_david/ds8rega\n\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/Iota/comments/7oi9g8/why_is_everyone_so_critical_of_david_this_has_to/ds9rtbb\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/qb0ik4tgny401.jpg\n\nLastly and to no surprise, David conducts himself very professionally in this [interview](https://youtu.be/GwhJQ67zxbg) even when asked several tough questions about the coordinator and MIT criticism. \n\n##IOTA Devs do not respond appropriately to criticism\n\nWhen critiquers provide feedback that is ACTUALLY useful to the devs, then sure they'll be glad to hear it. So far not once has an outside dev brought up something that the IOTA devs found useful. Every single time it ends up being something that was already taken into consideration with the design and if the critiquer did an ounce of research they would know that. Thus you often find the IOTA devs dismissing their opinion as FUD and responding with hostility because all their critique is really doing is sending the message to their supporters that they are not supposed to like IOTA anymore.\n\nNick Johnson was a perfect example of this. The Ethereum community was co-existing [peacefully]with IOTA\u2019s community (as they do with nearly all alt coins) until Nick wrote his infamous article. Then almost overnight Ethereum decided it didn\u2019t like IOTA anymore and we\u2019ve been dealing with that shit since. As of today, add LTC to that list with Charlie\u2019s (even admitting) ignorant judgement of IOTA.\n\n12/17/2017: Add [John McAfee (bitcoin cash)](https://i.redd.it/rsizfpeyq5401.png) and [Peter Todd (bitcoin)](https://twitter.com/petertoddbtc/status/942206322023587840) to the list of public figures who have posted ignorantly on IOTA. \n\n##A lot of crypto communities certainly like to hate on IOTA...\n\nIOTA is disrupting the disrupters. It invented a completely new distributed ledger infrastructure (the tangle) that replaces the blockchain and solves all of its fundamental problems (namely fees and scaling). To give you an idea of this significance, 99% of the cryptocurrencies that exist are built on a block chain. These projects have billions of dollars invested into them meaning everyone in their communities are incentivized to see IOTA fail and spread as much FUD about it as possible. This includes well known organizations, public figures, and brands. Everyone commenting in these subreddits and crypto communities have their own personal money at stake and skin in the game. Misinformation campaigns, paid reddit posters, upvote/downvote bots, and corrupt moderators are all very real in this space.  \n\n\n\n**************\n\n#INVESTING\n\n##How do I buy IOTA\n\nhttps://medium.com/@fuo213/how-to-buy-iota-the-complete-guide-for-crypto-dummies-e63560caf921\n\n##What is the IOTA foundation?\n\nIOTA foundation is a non-profit established in Germany and recognized by the European Union. Blog post here: https://blog.iota.org/iota-foundation-fb61937c9a7e\n\n##How many companies and organizations are interested, partnered or actively using IOTA?\n\nA lot, and often too many to keep up with. \n\nhttps://reddit.com/r/Iota/comments/7f3dmx/list_of_known_iota_partnerships_corporate/\n\n##How was IOTA distributed?\n\nAll IOTAs that will ever exist were sold at the ICO in 2015. There was no % reserved for development. Devs had to buy in with their personal money. Community donated back 5% of all IOTA so the IOTA foundation could be setup.\n\n##No inflation schedule? No additional coins? How is this sustainable?\n\nInterestingly enough, IOTA is actually the only crypto that does not run into any problems with a currency cap and deflationaryism. Because there are zero fees, you will always be able to pay for something for exactly what it's worth using IOTA, no matter how small the value. If by chance in the future a single iota grows so large in value that it no longer allows someone to pay for something in fractions of a penny, the foundation would just add decimal points allowing for a tenth or a hundreth or a thousandth of an iota to be transacted with.\n\nTo give you some perspective, if a single IOTA equals 1 penny, IOTA would have a 27 trillion dollar market cap (100x that of Bitcoin's today) \n\n##IOTA is not for P2P, only for M2M\n\nWith the release of the trinity wallet, it's now dead simple for anyone to use IOTA funds for P2P. [Try it out](https://trinity.iota.org/).\n\n##Companies technically don\u2019t have to use the IOTA token\n\n[Yes they do](https://i.redd.it/t6gmplq0c2tz.jpg)\n\nWorth clarifying that 0 iota data transactions are perfectly fine and are welcomed since they still provide pow for 2 other transactions and help secure the network. In the early stages, these types of transactions will probably be what give us the tps/pow needed to remove the coordinator and allow the network defend 34% attacks organically.\n\nBut... if someone does not want to sell or exchange their data for free (0 IOTA transaction), then Dominic is saying that the IOTA token must be used for that or any exchange in value on the network.\n\nThis is inherently healthy for the ecosystem since it provides a neutral and non-profit middle ground that all parties/companies can trust. If one company made their own token it wouldn\u2019t be trusted since companies are incentivized by profits and nothing is stopping them from manipulating their token to make them more money. Thus, the IOTA foundation will not partner with anyone who refuses to take this option off the table.\n\n##All these companies are going to influence IOTA development!!\n\nThese companies have no influence on the development of IOTA. They either choose to use it or they don\u2019t.\n\n##Internet of things is cheap and will stay cheap\n\nInternet of things is one application of IOTA and considered by many to be the 4th industrial revolution. Go do some googling. IOTA having zero fees enables M2M for the first time in history. Also, if a crypto can do M2M it sure as shit can do M2P and P2P. M2M is hard mode.\n\n##IOTA surpassing speculation\n\nIOTA, through the data marketplace and [qubic](qubic.iota.org), will be the first crypto to surpass speculation and actually be used in the real world for something. From there, it will branch out into other use cases, such as P2P. Or maybe P2P use of IOTA will grow in parallel with M2M, because why not?\n\nhttps://blog.iota.org/iota-data-marketplace-cb6be463ac7f\n\n12/19/17 update: Bosch reinforces IOTA's break-out from speculation by buying IOTA tokens for its future use in the data marketplace. \nhttps://i.redd.it/8e5b8bi9ov401.png\n\nhttp://www.bosch-presse.de/pressportal/de/en/robert-bosch-venture-capital-makes-first-investment-in-distributed-ledger-technology-137411.html\n\n##Investing in a new project barely off the ground\n\nInvesting in a project in its early stages was something typically reserved for wealthy individuals/organizations before ICO\u2019s became a thing. With early investing comes much less hand holding and more responsibility on the user to know what they are doing. If you have a hard time accepting this responsibility, don\u2019t invest and wait for the technology to get easier for you. How many people actually knew how to use and mine bitcoin in 2009 before it had all its gui infrastructure?\n\nIOTA is a tangle, the first of its kind. NOT a copy paste blockchain. As a result wallets  and applications for IOTA are the first of their kind and translating the tangle into a nice clean user-friendly blockchain experience for the masses is even more taxing. \n\n##Why is the price of my coin falling?!\n\nThis may be the most asked question on any crypto subreddit but it's also the easiest to explain. The price typically falls when bad things happen to a coin or media fabricates bad news about a coin and a portion of investors take it seriously. The price increases when good things happen to a coin, such as a new exchange listing or a partnership announced etc.. The one piece that is often forgotten but trumps all these effects is something called \"market forces\".\n\nMarket forces is what happens to your coin when another coin gets a big news hit or a group of other coins get big news hits together. For example, when IOTA data marketplace released, IOTA hit a x5 bull run in a single week. But did you notice all the other alt coins in the red? There are a LOT of traders that are looking at the space as a whole and looking to get in on ANY bull action and will sell their other coins to do so. This effect can also be compounded over a long period of time such as what we witnessed when the bitcoin fork FOMO was going on and alt coins were squeezed continuously to feed it for weeks/months.\n\nThese examples really just scratch the surface of market forces but the big takeaway is that your coin or any coin will most certainly fall (or rise) in price at the result of what other coins are doing, with the most well known example being bitcoin\u2019s correlation to every coin on the market. If you don't want to play the market-force game or don't have time for it, then you can never go wrong buying and holding.\n\nIt's also important to note that there are layers of investors. There's a top layer of light-stepping investors that are a mixture of day traders and gamblers trying to jump in and jump out to make quick money then look for the next buying (or shorting) opportunity at another coin. There's a middle layer of buyers and holders who did their research, believe in the tech and placing their bets it will win out in the long run. And the bottom layer are the founders and devs that are in it till the bitter end and there to see the vision realized. When a coin goes on a bull run, always expect that any day the top layer is going to pack up and leave to the next coin. But the long game is all about that middle layer. That is the layer that will be giving the bear markets their price-drop resistance. That is why the meme \"HODL\" is so effective because it very elegantly simplifies this whole concept for the common joe and makes them a part of that middle layer regardless if they understand whats going on or not.\n\n*************\n\n#TECHNICAL\n\n##How is IOTA free and how does it scale\n\nIOTA is an altruistic system. Proof of work is done in IOTA just like bitcoin. Only a user\u2019s device/phone must do pow for 2 other transactions before issuing one of its own. Therefore no miners and no fees. And the network becomes faster the more transactions are posted. Because of this, spamming the network is encouraged since they provide pow for 2 other transactions and speed up the network.\n\n##IOTA is centralized\n\nIOTA is more decentralized than any blockchain crypto that relies on 5 pools of [miners](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/mining/china/), all largely based in China. Furthermore, the coordinator is not a server in the dev\u2019s basement that secretly processes all the transactions. It\u2019s several nodes all around the globe that add milestone transactions to show the direction of the IF\u2019s tangle within the DAG so people don\u2019t accidentally follow a fork from a malicious actor. Anyone with the know-how can fork the tangle right now with a double-spend. But no one would follow their fork because the coordinator reveals which tangle is the legit IF one. If the coordinator wasn\u2019t there (assuming low honest-transaction volume), there would be no way to discern which path to follow especially after the tangle diverges into forks of forks. Once throughout of honest transactions is significant enough, the \u201chonest tangle\u201d will replace the coordinated one and people will know which one to follow simply because it\u2019s the biggest one in the room. \n\nReferencing the coordinator is also [optional](https://www.reddit.com/r/Iota/comments/7717ms/at_what_point_will_iota_remove_the_validator/).\n\nAlso, if you research and understand how IOTA intends to work without the coordinator, it\u2019s easier to accept it for now as training wheels. I suggest reading pg 15 and on of the white paper analyzing in great depth how the network will defend different attack scenarios without a coordinator. For the past several months, IOTA foundation has been using St Petersburg college\u2019s super computer to stress test IOTA and learn when they can turn the coordinator off. There will likely be a blog about the results soon.\n\nThis is another great read covering double spends on IOTA without a coordinator: www.tangleblog.com/2017/07/10/is-double-spending-possible-with-iota/\n\nThis too: http://www.reddit.com/r/Iota/comments/7eix4a/any_iota_guru_that_can_explain_what_this_guy_is/dq5ijrm\n\nAlso this correspondence with Vitalik and Come_from_Beyond https://twitter.com/DavidSonstebo/status/932510087301779456\n\nAt the end of the day, outstanding claims require outstanding evidence and folks approaching IOTA with a \u201cI\u2019ll believe it when I see it\u201d attitude is completely understandable. It\u2019s all about your risk tolerance.\n\n##Can IOTA defend double spend attacks?\n\n99% of these \u201cbut did they think about double spend attacks?\u201d type questions could just be answered if people went and did their own research. Yes *of course* they thought about that. That\u2019s like crypto101\u2026\n\nwww.tangleblog.com/2017/07/10/is-double-spending-possible-with-iota/\n\n##Will IOTA have smart contracts?\n\nYes - qubic.iota.org\n\n##Trinary vs binary?\n\n\"By using a ternary number system, the amount of devices and cycles can be reduced significantly. In contrast to two-state devices, multistate devices provide better radix economy with the option for further scaling\"\n\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/srep36652\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/6jgbvb/iota_isnt_it_the_perfect_cryptocurrency/dje8os2/\n\n##Bitcoin with lightning network will make IOTA obsolete.\n\nIf you want lightning network, IOTA already released it.

Very important for businesses.\n\n##Coin privacy\n\nCentralized coin mixer is out that foundation runs. Logs are kept so they can collect data and improve it Folks can copy the coin mixer code and run it themselves. Goal is for mixer to be decentralized and ran by any node.\n\n##How do nodes scale? How on earth can all that data be stored?\n\nFull nodes store, update and verify from the last snapshot, which happens roughly every month. Its on the roadmap to make snapshotting automatic and up to each full node\u2019s discretion.With automatic snapshots, each full node will act as a partial perma-node and choose when to snapshot its tangle data. If someone wants to keep their tangle data for several months or even years, they could just choose not to snapshot. Or if they are limited on hard drive space, they could snapshot every week.\n\nPerma-nodes would store the entire history of the tangle from the genesis. These are optional and would likely only be created by companies who wish to sell historical access of the tangle as a service or companies who heavily use the tangle for their own data and want to have quick, convenient access to their data\u2019s history.\n\nSwarm nodes are also in development which will ease the burden on full nodes. https://blog.iota.org/iota-development-roadmap-74741f37ed01\n\n##Node discovery is manual?

        "post_body": "So, long story short, I started trading a year ago, been margin longing the whole run from 1k to 19k ( sometimes closing the top, sometimes closing too early or too late, but always making profit)\n\nI turned 3 lowly btc which I had from playing poker (at the time 3k) into nearly 200 BTC which was almost 4 million at the top and would be 2 million at current prices. \n\nI thought I was a trading genius, a god, whatever. Anyway, this is where the sadness starts.\n\nAfter the dump from 19k to 11k I went long at the bottom, and kept adding to my position on the bounce to 12k 13k, 14k. Then, at the 16k dead cat, my position was a further 100 BTC in profit. Instead of closing then and having a total 300 BTC, I increased leverage and increased my position size. This entire position was liquadated on the drop back to 12k, because my entry had moved up so much. I lost 100 btc paper profit and nearly 50 BTC margin. I was devasted, and down to 150 BTC total.\n\nAfter evaluating the situation, I came to the conclusion that the pump to 16k was a dead cat and that we are going lower. Therefore I shorted. At 12k. Added at 13k. Added at 14 and 15k. Got liquidated at the top at 17k. Another 50 BTC loss. Down to 100.\n\nThink, ok we made a higher high at 17k, uptrend back on. Went long. Got liquidated at 13k.\n\n50 BTC left. Devastated, unsure, no clue whats going on. Sat through the drop to 9k, when we bounced I thought it could be the bottom. Longed at 11500, panic closed 10500. When we went to 13k I was kicking myself for panic closing, went long at 12800.\n\nLiquidated this morning for my last bitcoin.\n\n3 BTC to 200, to 0\n\nAt this time I am still in shock, the last few months Ive neglected relationships and school, and Ive been daydreaming about living the high life rich as fuck with my millions.\n\nNow, I am nowhere.\n\nPosting this so others dont gamble away life changing money. Dont want donations or tips not posting an address dont PM me. I never want to hear the word btc again because I want to forget",

Then.. you put the blockchain validator on the NAS.. where does the video live?? Yep.. its now a little CDN node. So you can watch the content by paying tron tokens to view blockchain content, but you can also SERVE that blockchain content to OTHER people.\n\nSo.. China hasn't figured this out. But I have. Justin and Jack just changed censorship in China, and there will be no way PRC can stop them. Before, you pull off content by ordering the provider to turn off their network access.. Now, you have 511,000 individual nodes.. try to take THAT offline.\n\nClever Chinese man.. they always find a way. That's why China is keeping it down, they are loading up before this is understood.

        "post_body": "So I decided to jump ship and move from Bitcoin to Bitcoin Cash and here's why I think everyone else should too, I'm going to try and cross post this to Bitcoin subreddits but they tend to delete any post I make like this.\n\nAs soon as I heard about Bitcoin I was a fan of it, unlike others, I never got into Bitcoin to 'get rich' I started investing in around 2014 but unlike other people, I've not become wealthy as I've often spent my Bitcoin and used it as a form of payment.\n\nAfter all, this is what made me passionate about Bitcoin in the first place, the chance to use a decentralized currency, out of government control sending payments across the world for fractions of a cent. This was the very purpose of Bitcoin, this was it's heart and soul and what I loved about it.\n\nNow Bitcoin has totally lost it's identity and in my opinion is almost valueless, let me explain why.\n\nYesterday I purchased around \u00a3100 in Bitcoin, Coinbase went down during the crash so I purchased around \u00a350 on Blockchain.info and around \u00a350 on Coinbase when it came back up.\n\nI wanted to move the newly purchased coins to a different wallet so I could swap it for different Cryptocurrencies, I was shocked to find that it would cost me over \u00a330 in exchange fees just to move my \u00a3100 worth of Bitcoin.\n\nThis means that Bitcoin has become an option only for large investors who are investing several hundred if not thousands of pounds. It was no longer as a micro or small investor to invest in Bitcoin as to move it would take a significant chunk out of my investment.\n\nThis is higher fees than any bank or any other payment processor or financial institution out there. I can make investments on the stock market for less of a fee.\n\nIt's no surprise that Bitcoin has become a 'store of wealth' and has been this way for a long time bit I pose this question. Other than people making money and profit off of Bitcoin, what does it actually offer that's unique?\n\nBitcoin no longer offers anything, technically speaking the technology behind it is dated, null and void. It's like investing in a company that refuses to adapt, change or offer anything unique, new or exciting. Granted Bitcoin had it's advantage as a first mover but the communities stubbornness not to adapt and change and keep it's core initial goals at it's heart will be the death of Bitcoin.\n\nI have no doubt the price will again rise and continue to go up as too many wealthy people have invested in it to just let it crash beyond recovery point right now. \n\nHowever, I think once investors see that the technology is no longer there and it actually offers NOTHING now that other Cryptocurrencies don't already offer or do better, then eventually the price will steadily fall.\n\nI moved to Bitcoin Cash because it's doing what Bitcoin should have done, it's the Cryptocurrency that Bitcoin should have been and did start out as, it's taking it back to the core purpose of why early adopters got on board and fell in love with Bitcoin and made it a success in the first place.\n\nThe point of this post really is to ask people to think about this logically, I'm not bashing on Bitcoin for no reason and I'm not trying to convert people. Honestly, I was kind of against Bitcoin Cash at first just because I don't like change and would have liked Bitcoin to make the scaling changes it needed to survive itself, I switched because it was the only logical, sensible thing to do.\n\n**TLDR: Bitcoin is worthless, even as a store of value it is rubbish, it has refused to adapt and change and is not scalable, the core purpose that won over early adopters to be a form of payment where you could send payments across the world in a fraction of a second for a fraction of a cent is no longer possible. Their refusal to change and adapt will make it the AOL or MySpace or Crypto, since it literally has no other use, other than a store of value atm, it can only be defined as a bubble which will collapse fast especially considering it's become too expensive for micro or small investors to enter the game now, it wont be long before it loses a lot of value and comes crashing down and a superior coin like Bitcoin Cash will take its place.**\n\nEDIT: Thank you so much for the Reddit Gold! So grateful :)\n\nCouple of inboxes asking for BCH address: 14jLRjzkbdQPNg37XozedPGiRYAFEWLrpi\n\nYou guys are awesome!",

        "post_body": "We released [version `0.7.0`](https://github.com/comit-network/xmr-btc-swap/releases/latest) of the XMR-BTC swap tool. This version is a patch release on top of `0.6.0` that defaults to `mainnet` when running a swap.\nWhen runnning on mainnet both CLI and ASB apply sane defaults (for e.g. node connection, fee estimation, ...).\n\nBefore running the software on mainnet make sure to familiarize yourself with the applications by swapping using the `--testnet` flag to swap on Bitcoin testnet3 and Monero Stagenet. Be aware that the software is still early stage and you are swapping at your own risk.\n\nBesides `mainnet` some more features got in:\n\n- swapping over Tor\n- json logs so one can more easily use tools to build on top of the applications\n- manual recovery commands and resume-only mode for the ASB\n\nFor details have a look at the changelogs of version [`0.6.0`](https://github.com/comit-network/xmr-btc-swap/releases/tag/0.6.0) and [`0.7.0`](https://github.com/comit-network/xmr-btc-swap/releases/tag/0.7.0)\n\nIn case you have been running the application before it is recommended to remove the old database directory before swapping because there were several breaking changes on the way to mainnet. Running a previous version will print the data directory on startup when you use the `--debug` flag. \n\n\nOur public `testnet` ASB is still running at:\n\n```\n--seller-addr /dnsaddr/xmr-btc-asb.coblox.tech \n--seller-peer-id 12D3KooWCdMKjesXMJz1SiZ7HgotrxuqhQJbP5sgBm2BwP1cqThi\n```\n\n\nMake sure you use the `--testnet` flag when connecting to a testnet ASB, i.e.: \n\n```\n./swap --testnet buy-xmr --receive-address [YOUR_MONERO_STAGNET_ADDRESS] --seller-addr /dnsaddr/xmr-btc-asb.coblox.tech --seller-peer-id 12D3KooWCdMKjesXMJz1SiZ7HgotrxuqhQJbP5sgBm2BwP1cqThi\n```\n\nIf you have Tor set up you can also swap with the public testnet demo through Tor:\n\n```\n--seller-addr /onion3/pzbmpqsyi2j2za2fwmiognupwozjlcoajbd3cgboetql7ooah63zywqd:9939\n--seller-peer-id 12D3KooWCdMKjesXMJz1SiZ7HgotrxuqhQJbP5sgBm2BwP1cqThi\n```\n\nDetails on how to configure Tor can be found [here](https://github.com/comit-network/xmr-btc-swap/tree/0.7.0/docs/asb#tor-and-hidden-services).",

If the current answer to the FAQ lacks details, use the comment function to ask more specific.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOur goal is to keep a good information / noise ratio at /r/NEO and we therefore ask for your understanding if we delete submissions violating any of the rules outlined above.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**[FAQ]**\n\n1. **[Where can i find (not-so-technical) background information on NEO/AntShares? How is it different? What issues does it solve?](https://www.reddit.com/r/NEO/comments/6p7fvu/basic_knowledge_and_background_info_resources/)**\n\n2. **[How to speedup the windows wallet sync?](https://www.reddit.com/r/NEO/comments/6p7fk1/tutorial_how_to_speedup_neo_blockchain/)**\n\n3. **How to use the desktop wallet?**\n *  A1: **[Basic wallet guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/Antshares/comments/6j8pcp/a_basic_guide_to_the_antshares_pc_wallet)**\n *  A2: **[Special attention for wallets with multiple addresses aka \"Change mechanism\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/Antshares/comments/6k7vxi/attention_behaviour_of_desktop_wallet_with/)**\n *  A3: **[Many wallet questions answered in the replies of this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Antshares/comments/6ie1kg/wallets/)**\n\n4. **I withdrew my NEO from an exchange but they are not showing up in my desktop wallet**\n * A1: Stay calm. Currently there are plenty reasons why this could be the case. The most likely ones: Wallet not synced (see sync speedup FAQ), corrupted DB (try rebuilding index via wallet menu), firewall prevents sync (grant wallet access in windows firewall). Try to re-install the client or switch to another wallet (e.g. NEO web or OTCGO web). A more user-friendly light weighted wallet is on the way (CoZ Electron Wallet). To be reassured that your assets are safe, use one of the block explorer (side-bar) and enter your public address.\n\n5. **I imported my web wallet to the desktop wallet using the private key (WIF) but balance shows 0?**\n *  A1: See 4.\n\n6. **[How to claim GAS (former Antcoins)?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Antshares/comments/6eddt1/antcoins_anc_distribution_and_claim_tutorial/)**\n\n7. **Do i have to keep the wallet(s) open in order to gain GAS?**\n *  A1: No. The moment you moved NEO away from exchanges you will generate GAS (Binance.com does credit GAS as well, no moving necessary) Use one of the GAS calculators in the side bar to calculate GAS.\n\n8. **[How to buy GAS (former AntCoins) on 19800?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Antshares/comments/6kjgha/guide_for_buying_antcoin_on_19800com/)**\n\n9. **I just want to buy&hold - how to go about it?**\n * A1: Buy NEO/GAS from one of the exchanges listed in the side-bar. Generate a paper wallet (see sidebar) and move your NEO to the generated address. Keep a copy of the paper wallet!\n\n10. **[How to import wallet from web client into the desktop client?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Antshares/comments/6j6h0b/how_to_import_wallet_from_web_client_into_the/)**\n\n11. **How does NEOs dBFT consensus mechanism work?**\n * A1: [NEO Docs explanation](https://github.com/neo-project/docs/blob/master/en-us/node/consensus.md)\n * A2: [dBFT For Beginners](https://www.reddit.com/r/NEO/comments/6vlatx/dbft_beginners_explanation/)\n\n12. **[How does NEOs dBFT compare to Ethereums PoS consensus mechanism?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Antshares/comments/6nemjr/in_response_to_neo_vs_eth_security_dbft/)**\n\n13. **The NEO team holds 50M NEO, will this cause inflation?**\n *  A1: [Press conference by the Team [Video + English subtitles]](https://www.reddit.com/r/Antshares/comments/6nf62x/press_conference_on_50m_ans_distribution_june/)\n *  A2: [NEO inflation schedule](https://www.reddit.com/r/Antshares/comments/6knw16/antshares_inflation_schedule/)\n\n14. **Is there a fee for transactions?**\n *  A1: No - sending NEO is free. Only some exchanges (e.g. bittrex [UPDATE] (https://www.reddit.com/r/Antshares/comments/6kouxf/official_response_bittrex_and_ans_fees/)) charge this fee on their end.\n\n15. **[How can i request exchanges to add NEO?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Antshares/comments/6iodtz/campaign_for_ant_on_additional_exchanges/)**",

The hash comes to us.\n\nBCH can't compete with this unless they push for blocks much larger than what we're capable of and can fill them, not going to happen anytime soon. BTC hasn't got a hope in hell as the only time the fees rise is when they're at capacity, the more this happens the more users will leave for greener pasteurs.\n\nTo accelerate this process we need to build as many BSV services as we can that will start to bring in the fees.

It for sure sounds awesome.. and only cmd interface.. I said to myself \"Ok.. they are keeping it simple\", but looking at all those messages makes me really feel bad about this wallet.\n\nIt should be like this:\n1. run a bat script\n2. wait for deamon\n3. synch the wallet\n\nI already arrived to the step where it says \"Synchronization OK\" in green. So when I had the wallet running, I executed the \"address\" command, copied that address and send coins from the pool to that address..\n\n...and they never arrived. But after I started writing this post I found out that on the pool it says \"Withdrawal failed\", so something went wrong I guess. I tried again, this time with only a few coins. Now for the second attempt it says \"Sent\", but on my wallet I still see zero balance.. hm.. maybe I just need to wait for a few hours... in that case I will delete this post or something..\n\n**EDIT:**\nAfter the whole afternoon they arrived... it seems to me that the pool have problems on their side.

Well, here it is. For the rest of you who don't know what this is I'll fill you in... Some time back in late November after a night of drinking with some friends I came home and decided to check out /r/bitcoinmarkets to talk about Bitcoins. As you can see [in this thread ](http://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1rmc4m/can_you_guys_stop_bashing_the_bears/)I was so sure of my drunken predictions that I offered to eat a hat on video with ketchup if I was wrong. Well, I was wrong. Bitcoins and alcohol don't go well together. Lesson learned. I decided that I would actually go through with eating the hat but when it came down to it I always had something else I either needed or wanted to do in my free time instead. [In this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1v959g/daily_discussion_wednesday_january_15_2014/ceq1uog) you can see I got called out for not posting the video so I reached out to /u/seansoutpost to hold some of my bitcoins ransom for me until I actually did it. Sorry it took me so long to get around to it. Jason I know you're a busy man so whenever you get around to it is cool. PM me for an address. Shout-out to my dear friend [Collider6](http://www.youtube.com/user/Collider6) for doing the editing on the video.",

        "post_body": "First of all, before I list this information, I'm a bit taken back by how insulting some are on here. He's doing his damn best to explain things in English to everyone, and people are just insulting his attempt to do so. Also the fact that he's not just saying buzzwords... he's doing his best to be super forward facing to his backers. You can hear that he's genuine in his inflections.\n\nAlso, this is a very informal, Periscope stream. If anyone actually thought he'd have a Powerpoint or shit like that to be seen, you all greatly misunderstood what his plan was for tonight.\n\n**For anyone who wants to read the disorganized transcript of the Livestream, courtiously done by btcrazy as fast as he could, you can find that post here: [ROUGH TRANSCRIPT](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tronix/comments/7ogk2z/rough_transcription_of_the_livestream/)**\n\n\n\n**GENERAL**\n\n* Stream is dedicated to the Vision of Tron, his background, and Investors Backgrounds.\n\n**PERSONAL**\n\n* He is considering turning over control of PeiWo and moving to SanFrancisco to fully devote his time to Tron as he has the confidence they can handle PeiWo from where they are at.\n\n**PARTNERSHIPS**\n\n* Partnerships with a large social facing company such as Facebook, Tenecent (WeChat), etc clearly won't be the partner announcement, as he spent a decent amount of time talking about how he doesn't like the way they treat the users.\n* [Bitmain](https://www.bitmain.com/) Partnership - Largest Bitcoin Miner Company in China\n* [oBike](https://www.o.bike/) Partnership\n* [Gifto](https://gifto.io/) Partnership - He's on their Board of Directors and the company was Created by the founders of Up.Live. Gifto will be releasing a new coin on their network (believed to be Tron right now) (More information about Gifto [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tronix/comments/7ogj31/takeaways_from_justins_livestream/ds9dk48/))\n\n**TRON PLATFORM**\n\n* Decentralized internet platform that stops all the data aggregation and rewards the content creators instead of the companies that host the platform itself.\n* Your private key will be your Login to all TRX Apps, ultimately allowing your accounts to be as secure as your current crypto investments.\n\n**TRON PIPELINE**\n\n* Hired 10 people last week on the application integration\n* At least 5 NASDAQ Public listed companies are partnered with them, but due to their own discretion, will be annouced at a later time by both parties.\n* With these major new partnerships, these need to be finalized and that takes time, so everyone should be patient while these announcements roll out\n\n**TRON DOGS**\n\n* Year of the Puppy(Dog) hence the point of making the initial launch of pets focused on TRON Dogs. The game is still being fleshed out with many other features.\n\n**TEAM MEMBERS**\n\n* I won't lie, I understood the function of the people he was talking about, and they have great backgrounds, but I won't make a half-assed attempt to write their names here. If anyone can speak about this, the information was definitely present in the stream.\n* People from Microsoft, Alibaba, JD and PKU have joined the team. If anyone can list these names and what he said their part is in this below, I will gladly add to the post.\n\n**TRON GIVEAWAY**\n\n* 5 Individuals who re-tweeted during the stream will be awarded 80 TRON, which was set by their marketing beforehand. He hopes by next stream to greatly increase this amount.\n\n\n\n**LASTLY, Periscope crashed, so he is having an AMA to the best of his abilites here:**\nhttps://twitter.com/justinsuntron/status/949475975229685760\n\n*[Permalink](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tronix/comments/7ogj31/takeaways_from_justins_livestream/ds9fp7m/) about my Wife who speaks Mandarin watching his Mandarin stream.*  \n\n\n*There will be rolling edits to this post as more accurate information that was missed is collected.*  \n\n*[LINK](https://weibo.com/tv/l/JFSzPy7319YnH2QW) - This is his stream in Mandarin incase anyone wants to see.*",

        "post_body": "Hello, I am writing this post for everybody interested in Stellar network/XLM investment and I am going to present you my point of view on Stellar. Please do not care about my English, as it's not my native language. I am new to Reddit, but I have been a huge fan of crypto since a few months and before putting my money in any coin I make a solid research everytime. This is what convinced me to invest in Stellar and may convince you as well.\n\n**In my opinion XLM will be huge due to many reasons:**\n\n**1.** FairX exchange is being built on Stellar network. This exchange will be released probably in Q1-Q2 2018 and will allow you buy cryptocurrencies instantly with fiat currency. In may opinion it may just kill Coinbase because: \n\n**a)** you will be able to buy much more cryptocurrencies than just 3 (Coinbase) \n**b)** Stellar network processing rate is 1000 operations per second (so they probably won't suspend deposits/withdrawals/transactions like on many other exchanges \n**c)** It has IBM's support d) Stellar network transaction fee is a fraction of a cent (0.00001 XLM) e) You won't have to pay any extra bank fee for conversion to EUR/USD from your local currency unlike on Coinbase\n\n**2.** It has IBM's support, which is a major IT company. I really doubt that they would back up/invest in something that isn't worth it.\n\n**3.** Stellar's team is full of great names, for example \n\n**a)** Jed McCaleb who is a: \n-co-founder of RIPPLE and probably still holding a few billion XRP coins,\n-co-founder of Mt. Gox - one of the biggest BTC exchanges from the past,\n-creator of eDonkey - big file sharing platform \n**b)** Stellar is being backed up by advisors such as:\nPatrick Collison - CEO of STRIPE\nMatt Mullenweg - a founder of WORDPRESS.COM\nNaval Ravikant - CEO and co-founder of ANGEL LIST\n\n**4.** In my opinion Stellar is very undervalued project. It's somehow similar to Ripple, but still doesn't have as much attention as it deserves. Once they will announce new partnerships/customers people will start to see, that Stellar has great potential as I am trying to show you now. It's worth noticing that XLM has 2x less coins in circulation than XRP at this moment, that means that if we reached Ripple's market cap, the price would be 2 times higher.\n\n**5.** It's now in top 10 coins, so it's gaining more and more attention and investors. I see a hundreds of newcomers everyday on Telegram group and Reddit, Twitter etc. and as you probably know that if more people know about it, the more money will be pumped in it. Newcomers are more likely to invest in something in top 10 rather than something with small market cap.\n\n**6.** Ripple and Stellar use similar code and fundamentals of these two projects are similar in some aspects, anyway Ripple is more for banks, when Stellar is more for people and companies. I met some people that are against banking systems and that's why they entered crypto world. Even though they see potential in the value of XRP they won't invest in it, just because it's very related to banks. They have their rules.\n\n**7.** They had a significant number of meetings in December 2017 in Dubai, Singapore, Abu Dhabi etc. it may just be a sign there is something big going to happen.\n\n**8.** ICOs - something that Ripple can't provide. ICOs can be built using Stellar. Recent ones are SureRemit, Mobius and Ternio.\n\nTo sum up; I wouldn't expect XLM to go in double-digit this year, but I think that $3-4 is reachable as far as crypto market won't crash due to any reason. Just buy, hold and forget about it for a while. Check the price in Q3-Q4 and in my opinion you will be surprised. I could point some more reasons why XLM is a great investment, but I picked up the most important ones in my opinion.\nI am not any kind of professional financial adviser and I am far from that, I just wanted to present you my thoughts about Stellar. Thank you for reading! :)\n\n**BTW: The roadmap for 2018 is going to be released this month on 25th. It may bring us even more fantastic news/facts, so stay tuned :)**",

It's fine to rejoice and celebrate milestones such as 'the volume flippening' of Ethereum to IOTA, but IOTA is fundamentally not about the market cap. Currently, virtually all posts in here are about the price or exchanges, this is not what this subreddit is for. This subreddit is for the IOTA project, not the IOTA price, we have /r/iotamarkets and /r/cryptomarkets for that.\n\nThe thing that made IOTA great in the first place is its insistence on focusing on actual progress and the cutting edge technology that it is. **I want more brainstorming about use cases, see more meetups arranged, more discussions about the technology itself, the different modules etc.** \n\nThere's still lots of interesting things on the calendar for IOTA in December alone, but we as a community need to ensure we don't become obsessed with the market cap and lose sight of the long-term vision and goal.",

The document revealed their plans to go heavy into a relatively small, but well proven and very unique Proof of Stake User Data Protection cryptocurrency PIVX. It all makes sense now, PIVX 5.0 is rumored to be released on testnet in the upcoming days, aligned with the Ethereum 2.0 soft launch on December 1st. PIVX is already rising with huge volume. According to the leaked document, PIVX is expected to rise 30x in 2021, which is around $9 per coin.\n\nI have been doing some research, the technology behind PIVX is really impressive same as what they are intending to achieve in the upcoming months: anonymous masternodes, anonymous governance model with anonymous voting, anonymous staking and some major improvements on their Proof of Stake consensus to decentralize the network much further and also incentivize shielded staking.\n\nCheck the [Tweet here](https://twitter.com/privacy_anycost/status/1330293503797194759?s=21), or directly the [leaked document here](https://gofile.io/d/CwOUpz).\n\nAs always, DYOR, but this looks pretty impressive.",

More than that though - it risks the integrity of the space in which it occurs and that is a black mark on the ecosystem, that has a fundamentally negative (and cumulatively so) effect on the likes of BSC or any blockchain. This is the opposite of what we want.\n\nAs the speed and accessibility of defi improves, opening it up to more users, so too will the scope for scammers increase. Indeed, since BSC is much cheaper than Ethereum, scammers have migrated over and there is a real need for safe projects. Safe not just in name but in deliverables too - to ensure the ecosystems in which they are built are trusted in the long term - otherwise there is the risk of the perceived integrity of those spaces being eroded.\n\nI\u2019m relatively new to crypto but this has become apparent very quickly and I have been extremely cautious in my approach (slow and steady) and I\u2019m involved with a few projects with noble goals (by no means an assurance) - projects like SAFERmoon who aim to improve the space for all and are - to all intents and purposes - building positively. By allowing new projects (even those with no coding experience but a gem of an idea) to build their token on blocks of pre-audited and safe code, their tokens can be launched with greater trust \u2013 which benefits both the new project, investors and the ecosystem itself. But while noble is great, there has to be a benefit for us as investors and that comes from Utility. There are a raft of meme type coins - so investors who want to be a little safer, should definitely focus on utility. Hype can be infectious - but it can also be expensive if the potential scam is realised - tokens offering utility are more likely to be serious about the long term.\n\nWhile SAFERmoon are promising their new project generator (it\u2019s apparently almost finished) SAFERmoon have also been delivering for their holders. Repeatedly. Beyond reflections they have also offered 3 rounds of staking with other well respected BSC projects Blizzard Money and JetSwap Finance.\n\nSAFERmoon is currently the only RFI token to allow fee-free staking (no 10% cost to stake and unstake as is the case with all other RFI tokens) while still receiving reflection rewards on transactions of the native token. In fact, they achieved that within 3 weeks of their inception. SAFERmoon holders have been making money during the current bearish run, while holders of other tokens give their investors the ability to buy branded sweatshirts and offer promises to lean on.\n\nUltimately new investors in meme-type coins are generally dragged along in marketing and swept-up in promises. My advice is to take a step back and look for utility and genuine goals - this is a pretty standard piece of advice for big crypto but seems to be overlooked or plain ignored in the altcoin arena - certainly lower down the list. There are great projects out there, you just need to be objective and the gems will present themselves. \n\nIf it\u2019s JUST hype / promises, be wary!\n\nhttps://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/safermoon/",

Particularly XRB since it's focus is human-to-human value transfer.\n\nDo you guys think there is still room for Dash in this kind of environment? Why should I choose Dash over RaiBlocks when RaiBlocks' transactions are completely free, near instant, and scalable?",

I also don't think governance is as big of an issue if you have a strong leadership team (e.g. Vitalik and ETH), but I guess that remains to be seen.\n\nAs for XRB criticisms, my biggest concern is definitely it's unproven nature, but all new technologies run into that issue. So far, I have seen no indication that any of the potential issues are unfixable. Those issues are also still *potential* issues, since the XRB network is working as advertised today.\n\nNodes are lightweight and currently their are over 2000 with no explicit incentive. The incentive is being able to use XRB's amazing benefits.\n\nScalability could be an issue, but conceptually it doesn't look like it will be, and we can't know until we know anyways."

I am very excited you're interested in knowing more about DASH -- digital cash.\n\nIn short, this is what sets us apart:\n\n1 - Our second tier of infrastructure (masternodes) makes three things possible: PrivateSend (privacy via improved implementation of CoinJoin), InstantSend (input locks for instant confirmations), and incentivized governance (staked voting rights for all big decision-making). Our masternodes voted long ago to increase our block size when it's needed, for example.\n\n2 - However, we don't believe these features alone are enough to get the \"average person\" willing and interested to switch to Dash as their money! So we're working on what we call \"Evolution,\" which should look and feel something like the Venmo of cryptocurrency -- all without the third parties. Preview video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7J4m04Tkfb4). The kind of traffic we're hoping to attract with Evolution will require massive scaling on our part, and because our masternodes are paid well, we can demand that they upgrade their hardware and bandwidth accordingly.\n\n3 - We have a treasury. This is because after allocating 45% of our block reward to miners and 45% to masternodes, there's 10% left over. Our masternodes cast monthly votes on how to allocate this money, which is currently worth $1 million+ per month. Anyone can apply for these funds to further the Dash ecosystem. What's being funded this month? See [this site](http://dashvotetracker.com). _Note: our Core developers apply for funds just like anyone else, which means that should they fail to deliver, their current salary can be re-allocated to a different development team._\n\nThat's about it! We've got additional resources listed for you in the sidebar of this subreddit. Thanks again for stopping by, and we hope you come back again and again.\n\n-- Amanda",

If they forget that, then they will need their seed phrase.\n\nSo an app might store their username and password but it won't store their seed phrase."

Everyone at\u00a0NEO wants to build a solid foundation for this very promising project, so it\u2019s regretful that such news was posted from our account, hurting our reputation we have gradually built up.\n\nThe community was quick in pointing this out. This is a testament to the strength and resolve of you all. Without you, NEO would not be on the journey it is todayand we would like to thank you for such overwhelming support and trust.\n\nMoving forward we took appropriate measures with respect to how we will post on social media, this is to ensure no fake articles or misleading information is used.\n\nNEO have some genuine and exciting announcements planned for the future and we cannot wait to share them with you all.\n\nThank you for your support and confidence,\n\n*NEO Council*",

        "post_body": "I'm new to the crypto scene and doing my best to learn what I can, but there is a lot to learn. I'm focusing on the fundamentals right now, like what is a Blockchain and all that, and how mining works etc. \n\nBut obviously a significant topic of conversation at the moment is the bitcoin coin split. I've read about this topic too, of course, but I'm finding the things I've read don't seem to square with the massive amount of hate that seems to exist between the two camps. I go to this subreddit and it's pretty open disdain for those who support BCH and I go to r/btc and it's vice versa. \n\nI'm trying to understand the mutual hatred here. A technical change like a fork and a decision between bigger and smaller blocks doesn't seem like something that would necessarily infused with such mutual hatred.... but here we are.\n\nTo try and understand this a bit more - including the politics behind the divide - does anyone have any articles they've come across that they have found explains the issue well? Even if it is one-sided, if it defends its position we'll, I'd still be interested in reading it, while keeping in mind the bias of the writer.\n\nI'm just trying to understand the situation more, so any link to articles you have found helpful would be much appreciated!!\n\nEdit 1: Holy crap!  This blew up! I'm in Korea (cryptocurrencies are big here!!) at the moment, and woke up to a veritable gold mine of information here, so I'm just getting to work through all the comments that were added since last night now!  So trust me; I'm making my way through all of this!  \n\nI also want to say - for such a contentious topic (where it is clear there is a lot of history and where many of you have thrown in with one lot or the other) - thank you for keeping things civil here, as well as doing your best to help a person new to all this inform himself.  Sometimes, from the outside looking in, the 'big-blocker vs. small-blocker' dispute seems a bit like the United Atheist Alliance going to war against the Allied Athiest Alliance, so I greatly appreciated the opportunity you have all given me to inform myself and come to my own evaluation of what is going on. So again, thank you.   I didn't expect a response quite this awesome, and I think the fact that there is so much here is a testament to how good this community really is. At this point, the thread has taken on a life of its own, and I feel that as bitcoin and cryptomarkets grow, this thread is going to help quite a few of us curious souls new to all this wandering in from the cold.  \n\nSo again, to everyone who took the time to contribute here, thank you, and may Satoshi him(her?)-self smile upon your good fortune.\n\nEdit 2: I would also just like to say two more quick things.  First, I hope you don't mind if I ask questions below to some of you in places where I am a bit unclear about things.  And second, I'm just going to preemptively reiterate: I am new to all this, and am not on any one 'side'; in my questions I may make statements as I attempt to clarify things for myself, and those statements may either be supporting or attacking your 'side', but that is only because I'm trying to understand, and not because I am actually on one 'side' or the other.",

Do you even realize, or does everyone realize that the fact that they are comparing Stellar to Ethereum speaks extremely highly of Stellar? Because, essentially, Stellar is doing very similar things to Ethereum, yet, it\u2019s .48 cents, while Ethereum is $2700!! So imagine Stellar XLM\u2019s potential...! It can literally go parabolic like we haven't seen...  Stellar seems to be more and more implemented every day all over the world, with news like the Templeton news, future city in Uganda (Akon) , IBM, Coinbase card coming out soon, with XLM 4% rewards, etc.**\n\n**What true potential do you all see then in Stellar\u2019s price? Think about it. Again, how high can it realistically go up, if it does the same things than Ethereum, or in a very similar way, but even better in some aspects? For example their transaction fees are incredibly cheaper, next to nothing, compared to Ethereum, which is already great. Imagine Stellar's potential!**  \n\n**It sounds like holders of Stellar could truly become the next generation of crypto millionaires.

When a stock or coin is on a crazy run and seemingly has no bottom or no top, at that point it is panic and emotion that is driving it.  It will correct, virtually every time.  \n\nLots of whales put limit orders at a certain number and when it hits,  it's going to bounce.  That's exactly what happened here.  Trading with emotion will typically lead to buying when the stock is on the rise and selling when it's going down, which usually leads to losses.  \n\nI've made tons of mistakes in the past as well, but you'll learn and get much better for it.  You have to fail before you can succeed :)"

I stumbled upon waves.exchange and swop.fi of course which I think are state-of-the-art but with poor liquidity so far. I'm impressed with the speed and low fees though.\n\nSo, my question is, why is Waves so underrated (or unpopular) despite all these advantages? I've heard Waves has been around for over 4 years now, but it seems like other ETH killers have overtaken it at least in popularity (ADA, XTZ, the newcomers EGLD, AVAX and others are being talked about more). Is there any fundamental reason as to why? or is Waves just not into marketing? Is it not fully decentralized? or did it get hacked before? I'd appreciate any insight as I'm actually thinking of deep diving into the Waves ecosystem soon.",

        "post_body": "1. Hop on bitcoin.tax and upload all of your trades, if you made over 100 trades in 2017, you will need to purchase the 40ish dollar premium license.\n\n2. After you've uploaded all of your trades into bitcoin.tax, (For upload, you have the option of manual entry, .csv upload, or API link) you will need to save everything as a .txf file. In order to do this you will need to go to Reports & Export =>Download => and finally \"Turbotax CD/Download / H&R Block.\" This will save your 2017 trade history as a .txf file.\n\n3. Unfortunately, the only way you can upload your trades to Turbotax is by buying a physical copy of the software. I bought the Premier Version ($70,) it's geared towards those with investments. I have no clue as to how well any other version might work.\n\n4. Once you open Turbotax, go to Federal Taxes => Wages & Income => Investment Income => Stocks, Mutual Funds, Bonds, Other. This is where you will be able to upload all your 2017 trades in the form of the .txf file provided by Bitcoin.tax. It will ask if you have a 1099-B, click yes, and then upload the .txf file from Bitcoin.tax. This will automatically upload all of your trades to Turbotax, and you should be good to go. If it asks you to provide a name for the financial institution through which these assets were acquired, I put \"No Financial Institution.\"\n\n5. If you are worried in any way about being audited, Turbotax does offer an Audit Protection service for $45 bucks. If you are audited, Turbotax will take care of all of it.\n\nA couple of things to keep in mind: \n\n1. It is not the case that you are only taxed when you cash out to fiat. You are only taxed on a percentage of your realized gains, meaning a percentage of the profits from the sale of any crypto. This means when you sell something for BTC, you will be taxed on the sale of whatever crypto you sold for BTC, and then any gains made by the BTC while you hold it waiting to buy something else.\n\n2. Filing this year may save your ass next year. Filing an amended return is a nightmare, and then paying tax penalties is even worse. Penalties can be up to 75% in some cases. If you need some extra time, file for an extension. It's likely that the IRS will continue to devote more time and resources towards catching those who do not file their taxes on crypto. \n\n3. Bitcoin.tax does not seem to work well for everyone, and this is in no way a definitive guide.\n\nIf you have any questions I can try and answer them, although I may not be of much help. Thank you and I wish you all the best of luck!\n\nIf you found this helpful and are planning to use bitcoin.tax, please consider using my referral code...\nhttps://bitcoin.tax/r/P3QXCQVf",

        "post_title": "TRXDEX is it legit?",
        "post_body": "Hello everyone. I\u2019ve been part of the TrxDex \u201cteam\u201d until today. I had to quit being involved with TrxDex after the episode this morning when Reinhard (the only person in charge of TrxDex) invoked the 5th AML (anti-money laundering) directive passed on May 30th 2018 as a reason to not give TrxDex voters their rightful TRX rewards.\n\nI would like to dive into what the 5th AML Directive has to say about cryptocurrencies (which will only go in effect in 2020!!!):\n\n\u201cProviders engaged in exchange services **between virtual currencies and fiat currencies** (that is to say coins and banknotes that are designated as legal tender and electronic money, of a country, accepted as a medium of exchange in the issuing country) as well as **custodian wallet providers** are under no Union obligation to identify suspicious activity. Therefore, terrorist groups may be able to transfer money into the Union financial system or within virtual currency networks by concealing transfers or by benefiting from a certain degree of anonymity on those platforms. It is therefore essential to extend the scope of Directive (EU) 2015/849 so as to include providers engaged in exchange services between virtual currencies and fiat currencies as well as custodian wallet providers. For the purposes of anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT), competent authorities should be able, through obliged entities, to monitor the use of virtual currencies. Such monitoring would provide a balanced and proportional approach, safeguarding technical advances and the high degree of transparency attained in the field of alternative finance and social entrepreneurship.\u201d\n\nThis paragraph only targets centralized exchanges and wallet providers. There is NO mention of any **airdrops** or exchange between **virtual currencies and other virtual currencies**.\n\nThe next paragraph concerning virtual currencies is:\n\n\u201cThe anonymity of virtual currencies allows their potential misuse for criminal purposes. The inclusion of providers engaged in exchange services between **virtual currencies and fiat currencies and custodian wallet providers** will not entirely address the issue of anonymity attached to virtual currency transactions, as a large part of the virtual currency environment will remain anonymous because users can also transact without such providers. To combat the risks related to the anonymity, national Financial Intelligence Units (FIUs) should be able to obtain information allowing them to associate virtual currency addresses to the identity of the owner of virtual currency. In addition, the possibility to allow users to self-declare to designated authorities on a voluntary basis should be further assessed.\u201d\n\nIn this paragraph, the authorities simply address the fact that they are unable to completely monitor all transactions of virtual currencies (i.e. Decentralized Exchanges like TrxDex was supposed to be, transactions between users without any intermediary etc.) and suggest the matter should be assessed further.\n\nSource:  [https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32018L0843&from=EN](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32018L0843&from=EN)\n\nSo basically all Reinhard\u2019s arguments that the 5th AML Directive would cause legal repercussions to TrxDex are wrong and personally I consider them just an excuse to keep TRX for himself, while airdropping DEX, a currency without value, to all TrxDex Voters.\n\nWhen I asked Reinhard for proof that he talked to his \u201clawyers\u201d which advised him not to send the TRX, and also a screenshot of his discussions with the Tron Foundation regarding the matter, he played dumb and then simply stopped responding altogether. I kept insisting on him answering these questions, but he stopped writing on any of our private channels. Instead, he talked in private with Langdon (one of the other community managers) and instructed him what to say to the voters and what message to pin in the Telegram channel.\n\nAfter a while I was excluded from the TrxDex managers Telegram channel. I started telling people what happened in the main TrxDex Telegram channel, and after a while I was banned.\n\nI have nothing to gain by posting this, I am simply stating the facts. And the facts are that the TrxDex project :\n\n\\- has no Whitepaper (only some general bits written by myself and Langdon, Reinhard provided no input whatsoever\n\n\\- has no roadmap\n\n\\- has a team of 1 so called dev and an army of community managers trying to keep voters calm\n\n\\- has a broken website without any improvement in the last few weeks, which is down 50% of the time and which has a section where people can enter their actual private keys to \u201ctest\u201d the exchange. I\u2019m sure most people are wise enough not to put any of their real private keys in there, but maybe some are not so smart and actually do it.\n\n\\- There is little to no communication between Reinhard and the rest of the \u201cteam\u201d\n\n\\- Nobody from the \u201cteam\u201d knows Reinhard\u2019s real name or how he looks like. I asked him several times to put his LinkedIn profile in the Whitepaper Draft or in the Telegram Channel. He read the messages and never did.\n\nSome people said I shouldn\u2019t post this because it will hurt Tron\u2019s image. Some people called me a FUDder. The truth is, I don\u2019t really care. I\u2019m doing the right thing and that\u2019s all that matters to me.\n\nYou want a true democracy in the SR elections? Then this type of information should reach the people voting for TrxDex. And then, they can make their own decision if they want to continue voting or not. I actually believe that this will prove one of two things:\n\n1. Either voters will penalize unprofessional SRs who try to deceive them by invoking irrelevant regulation.\n2. Or they will disregard all the information, mark it as \u201cFUD\u201d and continue voting hoping they will get rich by owning 5M DEX.\n\nTime will tell. I did my job. Good luck TrxDex voters. Good luck Tron !!\n\n\\-----\n\nEDIT:\n\nI forgot to mention TrxDexs' new plan of giving only DEX to all voters in the future, and then giving TRX out in trading competitions when the exchange launches (if it launches). Reinhard is basically giving all voters DEX which has 0 value, and keeping all the TRX which has some value for himself. All of this, to keep people voting for him until the end of August so he can stockpile all the TRX he can and then simply vanish without a trace.\n\nHow does that sound, ey?",

The attention that the market has garnered has made the average Joe believe that it\u2019s the future. However, prominent billionaire and Shark Tank star, Mark Cuban does not seem to be bullish about the metaverse.\n\nCuban appeared in a recent interview and was asked about the metaverse. He simply went on to suggest that it was \u201canything that we wanted it to be.\u201d Mocking the entire concept of the metaverse he said,\n\n\u201cPeople that focus on \\[virtual reality\\] VR want it to be the metaverse. Others want Web3 to be the metaverse. There is no rhyme or reason to it yet.\u201d\n\nOver the last couple of months, the crypto-verse has been witnessing the launch of several coin-centric metaverses. The networks have been trying to sell lands even before it was live. This prompted several into thinking if real estate would make it big virtually. Cuban, however, believed otherwise.\n\nMark Cuban said,\n\n\u201cThe worst part is that people are buying real estate in these places. That\u2019s just the dumbest shit ever.\u201d\n\nHe pointed out that the whole idea wasn\u2019t as good as URL or Ethereum Naming Service \\[ENS\\]. He further highlighted the unlimited volume that could be created.\n\nOn the contrary, metaverse real estate is expected to boom this year. Prominent analytics platform Metametric Solutions noted that taking real estate to the virtual world would surge to $1 billion in 2022.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nBillionaire investor Mark Cuban says buying land in the metaverse is the \"dumbest shit ever.\" The metaverse housing market has collapsed 85% from its peak earlier this year.

Do you want BTCP to look more like Tron and Verge \\(lambos and moons\\), or do you want to portray BTCP as a serious project?\n\nThere is tangible progress being made on this project on a monthly basis and the world needs to know about it.  So many people who are invested in crypto still have no idea BTCP even exists.  So many non\\-technical crypto investors have no concept of what zk\\-Snarks is, let alone why it is important.  Many others think BTCP is just a \"Rhett pump and dump scam\".  How do you combat these stigmas, and lack of awareness?  \n\nAnything that emphasizes the progress made to date and points out key milestones achieved on the roadmap would be good.   I understand that obtaining Ledger/Trezor support for BTCP may have been an \"easier\" goal to achieve for a BTC fork than with a non\\-forked project.  However, the fact remains that BTCP already has Ledger support in a matter of a few months, while \"established\" coins like Monero have struggled to achieve Ledger support for years.   \n\nBTCP's team needs to drive home that this project is at the forefront combating ASIC's and centralization.    When the Ethash and Equihash algorithms are dominated by Bitmain in the next few months, GPU miners who don't sell their hardware will flock in droves to projects that maintain an ongoing commitment to decentralization and ASIC resistance.  If you demonstrate to Bitmain that you are willing to hard\\-fork several times per year to maintain a decentralized network, it will not be worth their time to develop an ASIC for the coin.  \n\nMore miners mean more exposure, and more volume on exchanges.  More merchants who accept BTCP also means more exposure.  Volume and exposure are the keys to bigger exchange listings.  Mainstream exchange listings are so crucial to this project \"taking off\". "

        "post_body": "So, long story short, I started trading a year ago, been margin longing the whole run from 1k to 19k ( sometimes closing the top, sometimes closing too early or too late, but always making profit)\n\nI turned 3 lowly btc which I had from playing poker (at the time 3k) into nearly 200 BTC which was almost 4 million at the top and would be 2 million at current prices. \n\nI thought I was a trading genius, a god, whatever. Anyway, this is where the sadness starts.\n\nAfter the dump from 19k to 11k I went long at the bottom, and kept adding to my position on the bounce to 12k 13k, 14k. Then, at the 16k dead cat, my position was a further 100 BTC in profit. Instead of closing then and having a total 300 BTC, I increased leverage and increased my position size. This entire position was liquadated on the drop back to 12k, because my entry had moved up so much. I lost 100 btc paper profit and nearly 50 BTC margin. I was devasted, and down to 150 BTC total.\n\nAfter evaluating the situation, I came to the conclusion that the pump to 16k was a dead cat and that we are going lower. Therefore I shorted. At 12k. Added at 13k. Added at 14 and 15k. Got liquidated at the top at 17k. Another 50 BTC loss. Down to 100.\n\nThink, ok we made a higher high at 17k, uptrend back on. Went long. Got liquidated at 13k.\n\n50 BTC left. Devastated, unsure, no clue whats going on. Sat through the drop to 9k, when we bounced I thought it could be the bottom. Longed at 11500, panic closed 10500. When we went to 13k I was kicking myself for panic closing, went long at 12800.\n\nLiquidated this morning for my last bitcoin.\n\n3 BTC to 200, to 0\n\nAt this time I am still in shock, the last few months Ive neglected relationships and school, and Ive been daydreaming about living the high life rich as fuck with my millions.\n\nNow, I am nowhere.\n\nPosting this so others dont gamble away life changing money. Dont want donations or tips not posting an address dont PM me. I never want to hear the word btc again because I want to forget",

[This is the resulting thread](https://np.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/8njqm1/can_anyone_break_this_down_dash_private_send_vs/)\n\nI am going to reply to [**this comment**](https://np.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/8njqm1/can_anyone_break_this_down_dash_private_send_vs/dzw56nj/) in particluar and will debunk it almost word for word ([backup copy here](https://i.imgur.com/chaOsYL.png)). When I read it the first time it felt like the amount of falsehoods in it exceeded the amount of words used. That's why I decided to dedicate a thread to it. \n\nPlease note that I have posted a large collection of refutations, corrections and debunkings from other authors and myself [in the local wiki](https://old.reddit.com/r/dashpay/wiki/index#wiki_addendum.3A_misconceptions_on_dash_cleared_up) so if you're confronted with other lies, chances are good you'll find something useful in there, as trolls aren't very creative and regurgitate long debunked nonsense 99% of the time.\n\nAlright, enough of that, let's get to the meat of it:\n\nI am assuming you have read the full comment or have it in front of you.\n\n## The Debunking\n\n>Dash private send is basically a stupid mixing service\n\nNot nearly as stupid as obfuscating an entire blockchain [turning its encryption into a centralized point of failure.](https://steemit.com/cryptonote/@macrochip/warning-every-cryptonote-monero-transaction-in-history-will-be-retroactively-exposed)\n\n>that takes hours,\n\n*May* take hours. PrivateSend mixing speeds have been **significantly** improved in v12.1 and v12.2. Depending on the amount you want to mix you can get it done in less than one.\n\n>then supposedly gives you \"clean\" coins,\n\nNothing \"supposedly\" about it. They *are* clean coins. No one has proven it to be otherwise. [Can't say the same about Monero.](https://www.reddit.com/r/dashpay/comments/65fz68/dashs_privacy_feature_has_never_been_broken_turns/)\n\n>but as soon as you spend them you need to redo the whole thing again (to unlink your coins again)\n\n100% false and embarrassingly so due to fundamental ignorance on how PrivateSend works. You **don't** need to \"redo the whole thing again\". After mixing you have another balance known as the PrivateSend balance in your wallet. You can spend from that until it's depleted. Theoretically you could mix your entire Dash wealth (which you'd do only **once**) and spend it over the course of your life without having to mix ever again.\n\n>You need to trust a handful of masternodes and their providers\n\nAgain false. Double-false even: \n\n1. 4700 is not \"a handful\" of Masternodes. Moreover it's more than 3 times the nodes Monero has, so trying to belittle one of the strongest full node infrastructures in the entire crypto-space is quite pathetic.\n2. You don't need to trust anyone. The process is randomized and done over several rounds and over several Masternodes. **Trustlessness is an emerging property of decentralization** and Masternodes are exactly that [since they're spread across many countries and many providers.](https://np.reddit.com/r/dashpay/comments/7hhzcn/what_makes_dash_special/dqrrxu2/) \n\n>for that cumbersome anonymity.\n\nNot nearly as cumbersome as Monero's privacy with oversized transactions, [complete unscalability](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/5sd6rx/sidestepping_the_block_size_debate_for_a_second/dde78jp/), lack of solid infrastructure and [a blockchain so big](https://i.imgur.com/Knx4SRq.png) that nobody wants to run a sync for a full node, so the majority of users are forced to use [a centralized web-wallet service](https://mymonero.com/#/) where the admin, fluffypony, can see everyone's transactions. How's that for cumbersome? More like downright dangerous if you ask me. \n\nContrast that to: Mix once in your own ultra-fast syncing wallet, spend & confirm instantly. So \"cumbersome\"!\n\n>As there are not enough people using the feature to mix with you\n\nAgain false. Mixing times have improved significantly thanks to multisession-mixing since 12.1 and [an increasing amount of daily mixing transactions.](https://dashradar.com/charts/mixing-transactions-per-day)\n\n>there are so called liquidity providers, \n\nThere haven't been liquidity providers in Dash for at least a year, probably much longer.\n\n>that you need to trust as well.\n\n100% false and again ignorance on how PrivateSend works. A mixing party has zero insight on who they are mixing with/who the other parties are and even if they did: all information would be worthless with the next round of mixing, since they have no control over who they mix with. The network decides that randomly and unpredictably thanks to the entropy Proof of Work is providing us. But again: There are no liquidity providers anymore as independent mixing has been working well enough for quite a while now.\n\n>Unless you keep your wallets separate (exactly as with Bitcoin) anyone receiving funds from you can find out how much you own. \n\nThis is so false it makes your head spin. The PrivateSend balance in your wallet consists of hundreds, sometimes thousands of mixed inputs sitting each on newly generated addresses split into PrivateSend denominations that are indistinguishable from any other person's cloud of denominations. If you send someone a certain amount from your balance the wallet takes the appropriate denominations and \"stitches together\" the amount you wanna send. The recipient receives a load of identical inputs **with no earthly way of knowing** which wallet these coins originated from. You don't have to keep anything separate as your wallet does that for you anyway. Why wouldn't it?! Btw: PrivateSend is going to be supported by Dash mobile wallets as well.\n\n>Without even diving in the technicalities\n\nI guess you should have. I did (a little) and I have shown that Monero cannot scale and is deeply vulnerable in its privacy scheme. The fact that a fork of the project is enough to have users expose themselves should make any privacy minded person shudder.\n\n>anyone just using it once and being private from the get go\n\nBy \"get go\" you mean after waiting a week or two until the local client synced by downloading the oversized blockchain from 1500 Raspberry Pis or the moment you've created an account at MyMonero.com where at least one person knows your account balance and your tx history?\n\n>without hassle\n\nStill syncing, please stand by...\n\n>without standing out\n\nUntil the entire blockchain is exposed by cracking its single layer of encryption.\n\n>will immediately grasp what fungibility means and will have a hard time going back to any weak Bitcoin+whatever_crap_layer like Dash is.\n\nTalking about \"crap layer\" yet we have your very own Riccardo Spagni talk about how he wants to co-opt Dash's genius like so many other copycoins have already done, [**after finally admitting that you can't compete with Dash's Treasury system and thus its secondary layer.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=6189&v=oZVBS4-h-sE)\n\n## Questions to the general reader\n\n* Notice how this lie-ridden post is the top comment in that thread?\n* Notice how it doesn't even address the points raised by the comment OP quoted?\n* Notice how nobody from the Dash community ever spouted such flagrant lies about Monero? Or any other coin for that matter?\n* It gets better: Notice how that person carries the flair **\"XMR Core Team\"**? How many Dash Core Team members are spreading lies about other projects?\n* And finally: How much more evidence do you need that Monero is a toxic troll community **literally** *to its Core*? It's not just the comment itself proving it, but the amount of approval it receives.\n\nSo I challenge anyone who claims \"Dash isn't any better\" to demonstrate this sort of behaviour within this community.\n\nI end this thread with [one of my favorite quotes](https://i.imgur.com/19ZXgpS.png)",

        "post_body": "Hi All,\n\nThe recent announcement of adding Zcash to Cake Wallet has brought out very passionate voices against this move and some supporting it.  Honestly, we are humbled by how much passion is there in the monero world for Cake Wallet.  It\u2019s great to know that people are as passionate about Cake as the Cake Wallet team is.\n\nSome history: As some of you remember, Cake was built in a vacuum in 2017 funded fully by the founder and launched in 2018.  But after the launch, we became fully involved in the community and even took guidance from the community to open source the app.  Throughout the years, we have listened to the community on various things like what exchanges to add, or even what coins to add, etc.  Also since launch, we have been involved in many facets of the Monero world including donating to the dev fund, CCSs, related projects, competing projects, conferences, shows/podcasts, and much more.\n\nWhen we added BTC and LTC most monero folks didn\u2019t have a problem as these coins don\u2019t proclaim themselves to be privacy coins.  That brings us to Zcash and we can see how some might have problem with us adding it.  We have always worked with the community and now also have heard you loud and clear.\n\nBased on feedback, the following is the plan for Cake Technologies:\n\n* Drop everything and prioritize the Monero only app.  BTW, we have ALWAYS wanted to do a Monero only app for the hardcore folks. Our goal is to have this out by the end of the year and it will be available on Android and iOS.  It will still feature the exchanges and ultimately the buying of Monero through credit/debit cards.\n* Cake Wallet the current app will remain as it is now but may consider additional coins (like Ethereum or a stable coin or wownero) in the future.  Nothing will happen until we finish Monero only app.\n* For zcash, we will build a new and separate app.\n\nAgain we thank you all for the constructive feedback.   The above is not going to satisfy everyone as no plan is perfect, but the above plan does put Monero first.  Thank you all for reading.\n\nThe Cake Wallet Team\n\n[https://cakewallet.com](https://cakewallet.com)",

        "post_title": "Anonymity Improvements",
        "post_body": "Making an anonymous and untraceable cryptocurrency is, by no means, an easy task; blockchain is by default a public system. This is why Bytecoin developers were prompted to use unconventional methods to achieve anonymity: ring signatures to facilitate that anonymity and untraceable addresses to facilitate unlinkability. In this article, we want to examine these systems and describe what the upcoming changes to consensus regarding anonymity are all about. \n\nRing signatures are an elegant solution to a complex problem: how to make blockchain *verifiable*, but at the same time *preserve the anonymity* of senders. They solve it by allowing senders to mix other coins into the transaction to obscure the true origin of value in it. This system offered seven degrees of anonymity to the users: from 0 to 6. This number corresponds to the number of outputs (sometimes called *coins*) that are mixed in with the senders output in the transaction.\n\nBytecoin developers were surprised to see increased interest towards 0 anonymity. Turns out, users loved Bytecoin not only for its privacy and security, but also for its speed, reliability, and ease of use. It is important to say now, that by selecting 0 anonymity, the user still does not reveal their address (they are **never** revealed in Bytecoin). But what he does allow is anyone to track the movement of value between this user\u2019s transactions within the blockchain by connecting coins created in one transaction to their spendings in other (this is called *linkability*).\n\nIn order to prevent this, Bytecoin developers have decided to configure the daemon in the new release to send transactions with minimum anonymity being greater than 3. In addition, the mix-ins are now carefully selected only from those coins retaining their obfuscating value. This small adjustment makes all value movements obscure and makes all spendings more secure.\n\nWhile this configuration may generally require a little more economic effort (although 0 fee is still allowed), it brings a lot of value to the technology. Bytecoin has always been about security and privacy, and it is better to keep it true to its roots.\n\nYou can test out the new features soon in the Amethyst Beta release on the 12th of December, 2018. Stay tuned!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBest regards,\n\nThe Bytecoin Team\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*The topic of this article was selected at* [Bytecoin\u2019s official Twitter page](https://twitter.com/Bytecoin_BCN)*. Stay tuned for new polls.*",

        "post_title": "SDF update",
        "post_body": " \n\nI wanted to post quickly about some general concerns and questions people are having. \n\n**SDF lumen sales**\n\nSDF lumen sales are easy for anyone to examine since you can look at the Stellar ledger. You can see everything that SDF sells by monitoring this account:\n\n[https://stellar.expert/explorer/public/account/GAYOCVRRNXGQWREOZBDP4UEW475NKZKLA4EIEIBKBSJN2PQQWUQ5KGUH](https://stellar.expert/explorer/public/account/GAYOCVRRNXGQWREOZBDP4UEW475NKZKLA4EIEIBKBSJN2PQQWUQ5KGUH)\n\nOnly the transfers to Kraken are sales by SDF. Any other transaction on that account is SDF sending lumens to SBC winners, grant recipients, other parties (as part of our operations) but they are not lumen sales by SDF. Some of those parties do end up selling these lumens, and that\u2019s their choice to do so \u2014\u00a0but those transactions are not sales of lumens by SDF. If you review the account you can see SDF has sold under 20M lumens in the last 6 months. \n\nOur current ongoing plan is to sell enough lumens every month to cover our monthly burn (which is still not that high). Importantly we are not selling the inflation lumens we are receiving.\n\n**Inflation**\n\nWe said from the beginning that the inflation from the lumens that SDF holds will go into the pool of lumens that SDF can use for operations. We all want the Stellar network to thrive, and that takes money, resources, and most importantly great people working on it. These things are what these lumens go towards. If we find we don't need them for operations then we plan to add them to the pool of lumens we are distributing to the world. This is another reason we structured SDF as a [non-profit](https://www.stellar.org/about/nonprofit-status/) to mitigate fears of what we would do with excess lumens. In our case there are no shareholders so no one can walk away with SDF\u2019s held lumens. Our only goal is to use them in a way that most benefits the network and ecosystem.\n\nI personally think the inflation mechanism should be removed and began a discussion both here on reddit and on the core mailing list to try to build consensus around removing it. However there are a lot of people with valid reasons that still think inflation is a good idea. There is still work to be done to find the right balance of what to do here, and I hope the Stellar community can reach consensus on this soon. \n\n**Starlight**\n\nStarlight is the Lightning-like Stellar based payment channels protocol that we [posted about](https://www.stellar.org/blog/lightning-on-stellar-roadmap/) last year. When Interstellar was formed it had the right group of people to make the initial progress on Starlight and it [released a demo](https://medium.com/interstellar/starlight-payment-channels-on-stellar-3ff833c0d0ca) of it a few months ago. SDF is now taking over the development of this from Interstellar. While we thoroughly appreciate Interstellar\u2019s contribution, it makes a lot more sense for it to be an SDF project long term. In the meantime there will be some delay in its development while we build the team internally to take it over and bring the project out of beta. However, it is a very high priority for us and we will update everyone once we have an updated schedule for it.\n\n**SDF general plan**\n\nI know this remains more opaque than it should be. But there is a ton of work going on and I'm very excited for 2019. Our team has been overloaded and you are feeling it with the lack of communication. But right now our main focus is hiring and building the team that SDF needs. This latest newsletter announces a few people joining SDF and there are a bunch more coming over the next month. We hope to release an engineering roadmap shortly and an update to our general direction in February. ",

        "post_body": "The BitTorrent token project recently became the subject of an article about whether TRON provides the necessary processing capacity to handle the thousands of transactions per second required to make tokenizing BitTorrent work.\n\nBitTorrent parted ways with the former employee quoted in the article upon the early July completion of the acquisition. Since then, our BitTorrent engineering team has been joining their peer-to-peer expertise with TRON\u2019s blockchain team on our shared vision of remaking the internet.\n\nThe former employee, Simon Morris, got one thing right in his statement to an online cryptocurrency outlet: based on confidential research done while he was at BitTorrent, he describes the project\u2019s tremendous potential: \u201cAutomated auctions to prioritize download queues, Morris says, could make the entire BitTorrent network as much as 40 percent faster.\u201d That\u2019s why we embarked on such an ambitious project to expand our already vibrant community of 100 million monthly users.\n\nOur project [whitepaper](https://www.bittorrent.com/btt/btt-docs/BitTorrent_Token_Whitepaper.pdf) was published on Jan. 3rd, a full week before the online article, and answers some of the very questions posed by the former employee. In the whitepaper, we write: \u201cBitTorrent Inc. will deploy an \u2018on-chain/off-chain exchange,\u2019 which exists to facilitate the transfer of tokens between a high-performance private ledger and the public TRON blockchain.\u201d\n\nIn plain language, that means we are taking a hybrid approach. Why? Transferring files using the BitTorrent protocol involves splitting them into tiny pieces for exchange with many peers. Each exchange requires a micropayment, which is made off-chain. When the exchange is complete, these payments can then be anchored by on-chain consensus \u2014 a common approach on many blockchains today.\n\nAs we move toward a spring launch of BitTorrent token, we reiterate that we are truly excited about the potential for a tokenized P2P platform and what it can enable for creators who want more control over the files they share with others. We\u2019ve known all along that actions and execution are what will count for our community, and we remain committed to them.",

Most in this community tended to lean libertarian, and liked Bitcoin BTC's potential to take power away from governments & central banks.\n\nSatoshi left the project.  In the spirit of openness & freedom, Gavin & Mike naively made the mistake of letting too many bad actors (like Blockstream) gain access to the Bitcoin BTC project.\n\nThe Blockstream side had more money, and they had Theymos (who controls the #1 & #2 Bitcoin communities - rBitcoin & BitcoinTalk.org).  As a result, they were able to push enough of the community into believing that small blocks were the way to go.\n\nAs Gavin & Mike were being pushed out, they tried to create the first \"big block\" fork of Bitcoin, called Bitcoin XT.  The Blockstream / Bitcoin Core side hired a botnet operator to DDoS Bitcoin XT to death in its infancy.\n\n> From Mike Hearn:\n> \n> \"..After Blockstream successfully took over Bitcoin Core and expelled anyone who opposed them, Gavin and I forked Bitcoin Core to create Bitcoin XT, the first alternative node implementation to gain any serious usage. The creation of XT led to the imposition of censorship across all Bitcoin discussion forums and news outlets, resulted in the creation of this sub, and Core supporters paid a botnet operator to force XT nodes offline with DDoS attacks..\"\n\n- https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/89z483/ama_ask_mike_anything/\n \n- https://np.reddit.com/r/bitcoinxt/comments/3iumsr/udp_flood_ddos_attacks_against_xt_nodes/\n \n- https://twitter.com/peterktodd/status/641524932334235648 {[archived](http://archive.is/3JGcY)}\n\nGavin & Mike were pushed out.\n\nEven Brian Armstrong, the CEO of Coinbase, was censored by rBitcoin back in 2015:\n\n> \"I just unsubscribed rBitcoin and subscribed /r/btc\" - Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase (largest fiat gateway for crypto), Nov 2015\n\n- https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7x5rgp/flashback_i_just_unsubscribed_rbitcoin_and/\n\n- https://twitter.com/brian_armstrong/status/662817238676668416\n\n- https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3rejl9/coinbase_ceo_brian_armstrong_bip_101_is_the_best/cwpglh6/ \n\nEthereum founder Vitalik Buterin talks about the absurd censorship on rBitcoin:\n\n- https://youtube.com/watch?v=uL9VoxCFqT0\n\nBy 2016, the Bilderberg Group & AXA funded Blockstream, and the takeover was complete.\n\n- My List of Links & Sources: https://www.yours.org/content/how-the-bilderberg-group-took-over-bitcoin-btc-a823f9290fbc\n\nAny talk about \"big blocks\" and \"low fees\" was banned.\n\n- Censored Post: https://i.imgur.com/J4d7cc5.png \n\nIn August 2017, another attempt to create a \"big block\" fork happened, thus creating Bitcoin Cash (BCH).  And learning from the defeat of Bitcoin XT, this time around, Bitcoin Cash made sure they had the support of big miners, so the Blockstream / Bitcoin Core side couldn't use a botnet to DDoS it to death in the cradle.\n\nSo that is where we are today.\n\n- **Bitcoin BTC** has been taken over by the Bilderberg Group / Blockstream, deliberately crippled by small blocks & [high fees](https://i.imgur.com/wTDjdCE.png), so people will have to use the [Lightning Network](https://youtube.com/watch?v=UYHFrf5ci_g) & [sidechains](http://youtube.com/watch?v=0BZoKH-hX_o) (which is where [Bilderberg Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilderberg_Group) / [Blockstream](https://blockstream.com/2018/01/16/lightning-charge.html) will profit).  This was pushed through via brutal censorship on the #1 & #2 Bitcoin communities (rBitcoin & BitcoinTalk.org, which are both controlled by Theymos)\n\n- **Bitcoin Cash BCH** continues with bigger block size limits, low fees, and the \"P2P electronic cash system\" vision as laid out by Satoshi Nakamoto's Bitcoin whitepaper.\n\n",

        "post_body": "Greetings fellow cryptonians/Stellar Lumenaries, so today I used my Coinbase debit card for the 1st time to make some purchases at Costco and Dollar Tree. It went well. However, at Dollar Tree the chip wouldn't register on their machine but at Costco the chip worked. Had to swipe my card at Dollar Tree. Both stores are in Southern California (or as some call it here Commiefornia).\n\nCB debit offers **4%** on XLM and I spent:\n\n**$102.86 at Costco**\n\n**$23.33 at Dollar Tree**\n\nTotal was **$126.19** so I earned 4% which equals **$5.05**. From that **$5.05** I earned **15.7427 Stellar Lumens** (XLM). I felt a rush as I entered my pin code at the machine. I saw myself doing this countless times in my future to earn those sweet, sweet rewards in crypto.\n\nDoes Wells Fargo do this? No so F them.\n\nDoes JPMorgan Chase do this? No so F them.\n\nDoes Bank of America do this? No so F them.\n\nDoes CitiBank do this? No so F them.\n\n2021 introduced me to crypto after having heard the word Bitcoin sporadically here and there the last 10 years and not looking into it properly (like an idiot). Find any way to distance yourself from the old banking system. F them. Let them go extinct. They don't give AF about you, me, your momma or your daddy. This wonderful crypto community is so amazing and I've learned so much from everyone.\n\nI tried uploading a screenshot of my Coinbase app showing the **4%** in rewards on r/CryptoCurrency but I guess the mods on that sub don't allow us to upload pictures in posts anymore. Oh well.\n\nI chose to go with **4%** XLM even though they also offer 1% Bitcoin because I want to accumulate as many as I can and I believe in XLM very, very much. Almost zero gas fees and very fast so that's a big plus in my mind.\n\nIs anyone else using the CB debit card? My plan is to pay my car insurance and cell phone bill with the CB debit card, groceries, miscellaneous stuff, and when family goes to the market I offer to use my card and they'll give me the cash so I can go to the bank afterwards to deposit more dirty, dirty fiat (yuck) to top off my debit card.\n\nTldr: F the banks. Use CB debit. Earn rewards. The future is now, old man!\n\nEdit: Uploaded screenshot of my Coinbase app showing XLM rewards data.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/06b7glipidn71.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=76f9538759d933529013392c34f80891c1579c97",

Chinese regulators know Onchain and NEO very well, and treat them with sympathy and respect, as they really like what they are doing and how compliant they are. \n\nEverybody in this forum theoretically knew about the above-mentioned things, they knew that 99%of ICO are scams and regulations were needed for real world adoption, they knew that China's economy is regulated so there was a very high chance that licensing will be introduced. And still, knowing all this, people sold. And now they are shocked that CEO of Onchain is meeting with government rather than sitting in prison ;). Kudos to logic, dear users, kudos. \n\nI might be thankful, as I managed to triple my NEO stack since 1st of September (coin-wise, not dollar-wise). However, I am also worried as I cant see crypto going into 1trillion$ marketcap having investors with 8-years old patience, logic and nerves. Hope that our hands are stronger now after recent crash. Be smart, make smart decisions never based on what the colourful chart is showing. You are not, after all, a child with crayons and moon colourings, but a serious financial investor. Right?

        "post_body": "I've seen this over and over and over, \"Banks don't need to use XRP to use the Ripple ledger\".  TRUE!  But, here's why some are ALREADY using, and WILL ALL use XRP eventually.\n\nRipple's approach to adoption is two-fold:\n\n1) Get the banks to use their ledger software to send fiat money (without necessarily requiring XRP), instead of the SWIFT way.  This step is important because it doesn't radically change the way banks do things today, but it does give them some very valuable tools and real-time information about their money transfers.  This is what most Ripple-partnered banks are talking about when they say they are using Ripple's products.  What also comes with this software is a Ripple feature called xRapid, which leads us to step..\n\n2) Once banks are Ripple-integrated, they will have the 'option' of using XRP (via Ripple's xRapid feature), but they don't have to; but they will want to eventually; let me explain:\n\nThe first adoption step puts the option to use XRP right in front of the banks' noses.  And while at this time it may seem irrelevant to their existing infrastructure, it will be profoundly easy to start using XRP if they get curious.  Why would they want to use XRP then?\n\n- it would take very little effort to start using the integrated xRapid feature\n- they would save an additional 30% on transfer fees\n- their competitors are using it, undercutting them and taking business away\n- and most importantly: ELIMINATES NOSTRO ACCOUNTS!!!!!\n\nLet me say that again because it's super important\n\nUSING XRP ELIMINATES THE NEED FOR NOSTRO ACCOUNTS!!!...\n\n(To continue reading, I've moved this article to http://galgitron.net/Post/Heres-how-and-why-XRP-will-be-used-by-banks)",

I consider myself a realistic supporter.\n\nThe biggest problem within this project is the unrealistic expectations people created for themselves about this coin. The value proposition is great; there is a clear need for privacy combined with the name of Bitcoin. As a result, people started pumping ZCL to up to $200, and I saw people mentioning that they would never sell below $400. In retrospect, that was just unrealistic considering no (big) exchanges had announced support.\n\nThe team at the same time, can't be envied at this point. They're pushing ahead and working out update after update, and receive all accusations that are possible. Most of them joined way after the announcement and just wanted to join a nice community-driven project with GPU mining & privacy. They're running into problems with all the exchanges (shady shit going on i think, im pretty sure they'd be happy to pay big exchanges to list). And then at the same time a community thats screaming FUD & scam, with people from other projects joining to light the fire (ZenCash is doing it a lot on this subreddit).\n\nrhet's tweets aren't helping their cause either, i dont know how involved rhet is but I think the project is better off without him. \n\nits hard to say whats really go on behind the scene but i see a team thats pushing out update after update, but is thrown back every time by external factors. The shit that went down at Bittrex is a good example, and now also HitBTC that is delaying the listing. I dont know what the reason is, but it is clear the hardships only really happen with external parties involved.\n\nI'm not only keeping my BTCP right now, I'm using the current FUD and drama to buy more at this ridiculously low price.

I did this because CB charges outrageous fees for buying and selling and I would much rather use Solflare and Jupiter (Jup.ag) so that I can actually make a profit sometimes. Coinbase did not send my crypto, my SOL or my USDC, then they claimed I had to confirm my identity to remove my crypto. I confirmed my ID several times for each transaction, they denied it when it was obviously me and they had just accepted an ID check 3 days prior. \n\nI went to support about it and they literally would not release my crypto to me until SOL went back up and I no longer had the chance to buy it at a good enough price without their exorbitant fee. They said that they couldn't send it because the \"network was too clogged and I would get the money when it unclogged.\"\n\nI now realize that until my crypto leaves CB... it's not mine. I suspect what happened is that CB actually meant that they did not have enough money to give me back my crypto until the market went back up. \n\nLesson learned, if you are still using CB, do yourself a favor and get your crypto out as soon as you can, because I suspect CB is having more money troubles than they are letting on. Not my keys, not my crypto.\n\nEdit: Wow, thanks for all the upvotes! Sounds like this is a common problem unfortunately. \n\nSecond edit: If you have another mindless question, I'm not answering it.

        "post_body": "Everyone likes to play; which is why I'm educating this community with an Article on the topic of: Gamifying the Delivery of Money ( [paraphrasing an article from HackerNoon.com](https://hackernoon.com/gamifying-the-delivery-of-money-c55c25cecaee) )\n\nIf we can turn the distribution of this new \"money\" into a \"game\" of sorts, our success as a network will be all but guaranteed!\n\nThe existence, the physical universe is basically playful... So we can say without a doubt, that gamifying \"money\" will rapidly attract interest from the world's population, as any good game would. ( Alan Watts: Your Life Is Not A Journey; [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHnIJeE3LAI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHnIJeE3LAI) )\n\nThe layman's term goal of gamified money distribution is to simply get it evenly across the playing field, as quickly as possible, without devaluing the money. The essential reason for this is that, very simply; If everyone is playing the \"game\", the best players will soon join the lobby and queue up for a bit of \"play\"... (Attracting big players ensures the security of the \"game\", because big players will protect and support the game that they're \"playing\")\n\nSome of the most successful companies in the world \"gamified\" their company shares and experienced MASSIVE network effect growth because of this; Amazon paid their first employees with SHARES, not salaries... This incentivizes the employees to truly do their best work, knowing they will increase their \"piece of the pie\" evenly!\n\nThis is what \"blockchain\" is at it's core level, it is the most efficient & technologically advanced form of distributing \"shares\" for ANY idea/company/nation/person... If you see that, you're already a true believer!\n\n**Step 1: DESTROY your greed (partially)**\n\nThis is the easiest step, out of all 4 steps, just understand this one thing; As long as you have a slice of the pie, you simply focus on growing the pie, not the slice...You already have a share in this idea, so focusing on making the idea more powerful will increase the value of your shares, this is the beauty of a [network effect](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=network+effect) and is the only reason you've made ANY money at all in the Blockchain Industry... Do not fall prey to the \"[tragedy of the commons](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=tragedy+of+the+commons)\"\n\n**Step 2: Build (or buy) a Killer App**\n\nFirst off, [click here to see the definition of a \"killer app\"](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=killer+app) so your mind doesn't wander...BitTorrent is our killer app, and it may well be Blockchain's killer app; it is experiencing incentivization problems that highlight the dangers of the tragedy of the commons. This is a good thing, it gives Tron an opportunity to prove the use case of not only itself, but of all Blockchain technology' potential.\n\nCurrently, BitTorrent is experiencing problems with \"free riders\"; people who only download files (consuming bandwidth) and failing to upload those files after they are finished. Essentially, users of BitTorrent are doing what's best for them, but not what's best for the BitTorrent network & protocol...\n\nThis is not entirely their fault, Thomas Hobbes predicted some years ago; that to make a society function at massive scale, you need to have the right incentives in place. I'm sure all of us would mostly agree that the world currently has massive incentivization problems (ie. innocent homeless are starving, criminals in jail being fed/sheltered)\n\nIt is my understanding and belief that Justin Sun YuChen bought BitTorrent in an effort to prove the use-case of Tron and therefore Bitcoin & Blockchain by extension... He saw the problems BitTorrent was having, and he looks at them as opportunities to flex the power of a decentralized internet...\n\nThe TRX Coin would have amounted to nothing without a plan, without a Killer App, and you should know that Justin Sun has been trying to acquire BitTorrent since before the ICO started, he knew this... The coin is secondary, the coin is the \"fuel\", the \"gas\", he was focused on acquiring the \"vehicle\" first, as he should've...\n\n**Step 3: STEALTHILY Gamify the Killer App**\n\nThere's nothing worse than overt, upfront gamification...Just think about flashy Las Vegas, get rich quick schemes, and timeshares; THAT is overt gamification...\n\nWe need stealthy gamification... Imagine you have a sudden craving for a piece of content available on BitTorrent...You open your app, click download, and you're prompted with a request to \"skip\" the download time for 2 TRX, you click accept and your download is immediately available to fulfill your craving. Now think the same situation, but you don't need the content immediately, you can let it download while you cook your dinner. When you get back to your viewing device, the content is ready and you receive another pop-up request asking if you'd like to provide extra bandwidth to upload this video for others at a reward rate of 1 TRX per hour, you click accept, watch your movie and then suddenly get another craving... This time you don't want to wait, so you spend the 2 TRX you just earned...\n\nTHIS is stealth gamification... It does not feel like Vegas, or a slot-machine, or gambling... You simply use it, get value, provide value, and transfer value... STEALTH GAMIFICATION\n\n**REMEMBER THIS: Every person who adds to the value of the network, adds to the value of their AND everyone else's shares, which further incentives each party to continue adding value to the network.** (This is why you've seen exponential growth in Cryptocurrencies)\n\nNetwork Effect: \"Do what is best for the network, the network will thrive\"\n\nTragedy of the Commons: \"Do what is best for yourself, the network will die\"\n\nA proper network effect rewards those who benefit the network, and punishes those who exploit the network.\n\nBitTorrent has failed to truly succeed YET because they have only done half of the equation, they have only punished those who exploit the network (slowing download speeds for those who don't upload)... There is no \"reward\", they need the second portion of the equation, and TRX can provide that... effectively!\n\n**Step 4: Reinvest & Revolutionize Economics**\n\nIf TRX can be successful in building this network effect, and properly manage their greed long enough to accomplish that goal, it will create \"groups\" of different gamified networks all receiving a steady stream of income and that will do something incredible historically speaking: It will END the quarterly result so thoroughly craved by share holders around the world...\n\nRather than a network's value being represented by it's profits every 3 months, it will be truly and authentically represented by the power of the network, distinguishing itself in an entirely good way from typical stocks & shares in today's modern environment.\n\nDevelopers will no longer be forced to choose between producing a quality product, or pushing out some \"thing\" that will sell quickly and turn profit for the 3-month period... They will be directly incentivized to make the best quality product to increase their network effect, and therefore the value of their holdings...\n\n**ENDING NOTES:**\n\nIf you become a greedy entity who tries to control everything, strangling the system with centralized choke points to keep all the money for yourself, you\u2019ll accelerate the current collapse of our economic stability and break this world. Your crimes will live forever in infamy...\n\nBut if you can resist the urge to dominate, to control, to horde every resource, you can unlock the vast hidden potential of the world. Do that and your deeds will echo in the halls of eternity...\n\nYou. Just. Might. Save. The. World.",

        "post_title": "JACY - Shitcoin to AltCoin a Journey - My thesis on a burgeoning community and what focused dev teams are capable of!",
        "post_body": "A little bit of background: Jacy (formerly Jacywaya) is a token that originated towards the end of the last rush cycle. Jacywaya originally was developed with all the aspirations of a \"Meme Token.\" It had a cute fuzzy Inu mascot; the original contract was renounced, hype marketing was in full swing. Then the house of cards began to fall, the former developers started to withdraw and ultimately abandoned our sweet little Waya pup. The chart slid down, and hope was lost for the community at large, almost...\n\n  \nA small group came together and reached out to one of the former developers. They arranged to transfer the Waya contract, keys, and wallets. This team worked to secure the remaining liquidity and marketing/development funds. They socialized out these facts to a dwindling community on the original subreddit. People began to hope there was a chance that their investment was not lost. The new team, along with the support of the community, began to rebuild the token's social presence, rekindling the Telegram and creating a Discord group. Twitter, FB, IG, and Reddit began to reform as a unified brand. Interest in this comeback story began to spread; people came to support the underdog. Slowly, the chart reflected this positive change for a token rising like the phoenix.\n\n  \nThe holiday season proved very exciting for the community as a whole, the token reached new all-time highs, and no investor from the former project team was in the red. Everyone was excited to see where we could all go from here. The new team continued to engage the community, released a new website, and began developing a new project vision and white paper to share with the community. They were also working behind the scenes carving out a new smart contract, a new beginning to the Jacy story. \n\n  \nMigration day came, and as with all token migrations, not without its share of concerns and confusion. Not to mention inherent troubles when coordinating with 3rd parties such as Coin Market Cap, Coin Gecko, Coinbase, etc. Overall, the team executed a near-flawless deployment and migration of all wallet assets to this new flexible contract. January 8th, 2022, marked the proper start of the new Jacy project; we had left the Waya suffix and its Meme connotations behind. Once the team had completed the migration, the new white paper was released. A well-defined project scope, thorough tokenomics details, supporting history, and vision detailed. Now the community and potential investors could see what the team saw. A new sense of this project became clear, a long-term goal to become an impactful project to change how users could interact with Defi and NFTs. A solid project definition creates a bridge that clearly shows a project's intentions. Coupled with a team with the wisdom and experience across all the relevant subject domains to support and drive the mission, you have a recipe for success.\n\n  \nVision and execution are core to successfully developing a project; community is as important if not more so. The community that supports a project helps to guide and nurture. As the community grows, so does its voice. People talk about the projects that excite them; they bring in friends and family when confident in their investments. As the community grows, so does the project through investment in marketing and development. \n\n  \nJacy has engaged with professional marketing and begun to execute the development roadmap. As we all wait for this market overall to settle, I encourage you to take the time to review the [website](https://jacytoken.io), read the [white paper](https://jacytoken.io/Jacy-Token-WP.pdf), and join the [socials](https://linktr.ee/jacytoken). Once the market overall begins to surge, I have faith that Jacy will rise as well. I implore you to do the research and decide for yourself if Jacy may be suitable for your investment goals.\n\n  \nTo make a move from the proverbial shitcoin to altcoin is a journey. It is similar to the marketing of a new product. You have your early adopters, then a gap where a company or team must be committed and strong to weather the storm. Once you cross the gap and more investors begin to see the utility and overall strength, a project starts to mature and grow in value. Jacy token has weathered ups and downs both within the scope of the token and with the market overall. The current community base is proving to be solid and unwavering in commitment. We as a community have seen holders come and go, rebounding and growing further strength and size in our holder base through each gyration. I implore this community to research this project and make your own decision on whether you feel that Jacy may one day become an Altcoin and cross the proverbial gap.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/jacy/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/jacy/)\n\n[https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/jacy](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/jacy)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ekom0sx48me81.png?width=1303&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b84c3850b74ad5fa4b3635b8a629f9559034e55",

Informative content and objective discussions with a friendly attitude followed by a wider sense of the techs potential. Giving and caring, sharing, spreading the same dream and focusing on the bigger picture.. from the early days of this sub, lots of open-minded posts, comments and loving gestures were made with members freely contributing to this sense.  I used to come here for all the news I needed regarding Iota, the latest tech advancements, partnerships and movements, while having a good laugh at the fun being in the comments section.\n> \n> Seeing lots of new arrivals, negative mind sets and comments unintelligently driven by selfishness, self gain and short term profits, followed by posts on the same mentality level, polluting their greed and dullness onto the community, not giving a cue about the sub itself, forced me to submit my first post on Reddit since I've been using it. This section was not written in anger, rather in disappointment.  I want the technology I've invested in to grow, and it's going to be a lot harder if the whole sub eventually becomes /r/Bitcoin and IOTAs greatness gets neglected with memes about it's price going up. Newcomers are more than welcome and any questions should be properly answered, not trying to bash at them, but the same questions are being answered at least three times a day while quality content is being buried in between all the other randomly posted stuff. \n> \n> This post wasn't meant to be a subjective complaint, but an observation of this sub's rapid growth and new problems that emerge with it.\n> New members should be presented with the best content possible to understand how everything works and what they're getting into, spreading the news of IOTAs revolutionary idea thereby attracting more people. This won't be accomplished with a front page full of memes.\n> The goal of this post was to brainstorm solutions to emerging problems and encourage a creative discussion regarding the future of this sub, it's content, the tech, it's community and the way of dealing with newcomers, with the goal of providing viable solutions and plans of action. \n> \n> Cheers guys and happy investing. May a bright future be in front of IOTA and all of us.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n",

Meaning that for 29M$ donation, at current market cap of 23B, this would mean each of us part of the network would give about 0,13% of our coins into charity.

My portfolio is down to less than 1/5 of what I had at Christmas and this fork feels like a final stab in the heart that would seem to signal my ultimate defeat as a crypto trader/investor.  I feel misled about what BTCP really is.  It appears that in actuality, it essentially has nothing to do with bitcoin and as a privacy coin, it seems to pale in comparison to other awesome projects like Zen Cash which had been trading for months around only $20-60, so yes it feels very much like we are screwed.  On the other hand, getting listed on that Komodo DEX is nothing to shake a stick at even though it's still in beta.  As regulation continues to clamp down, decentralized exchanges will likely become the new home of crypto, the underground base from which the crypto-coin army will amplify and eventually annihilate fiat: the place we should have been trading from in the first place.  I believe this pressure of regulation will actually FUEL crypto's momentum in the long-term because subverting the deep state was what the cypher punks created this movement for in the first place and people have an inherent longing for true freedom and Independence.  Regulatory pressure may be be just what is needed to finally push mass volume over to decentralized platforms.  I've decided to essentially consider my BTCP HODLings a donation to the cypher punk vision (if it goes to zero) since at this point, I have so little left to lose.  Change takes sacrifice and I'm proud to have been a part of the process.  I've heard Rhett Creighton described as a visionary and likened to Steve Jobs.  Even tho Bitcoin Private is starting to look like a crappy privacy coin competitor at this point, it IS still a privacy coin (which in my opinion are the heart and soul of crypto) and if Rhett and the team are anything close to what they were originally cracked up to be, maybe they will turn this thing into something worthwhile in the long run... who knows how it will evolve or what it could become.  Only time will tell but I've come to the conclusion that at this point, the best option is just to put our efforts into supporting/working-with/encouraging the team, sharing ideas with the community, and shamelessly promoting the coin with whatever means possible.  It seems the main thing BTCP has going for it is the Bitcoin name being used as a marketing tactic.  Even though we are all feeling shitty about it right now, maybe what we should be doing is marketing the fuck out of it and telling all the newbs that it's the new \"real bitcoin\" and the only stealth-bitcoin you can buy!  After all, a bad-ass privacy coin that's meant to thrive in the underground shouldn't need to be listed on a mainstream exchange to be used and adopted by the people who are interested in these sorts of things anyway.  The main advantage of major exchange listings is that the coin gets recognized by more people.  Until that happens, it's up to us to spread the word and promote this thing."

Right now, the market value of 1 XRP is 0.2943c.\n\nLet\u2019s break down what the Company Ripple is doing.\n\nRipple has three major projects xVia, xCurrent and xRapid.\n\nxCurrent is an end-to-end tracking and messaging system that allows banks to communicate in real-time. This is an automated process that ensures all payments are properly tracked and accounted for.\n\nxRapid is the program that uses XRP, when banks want to send global payments xRapid sources liquidity from XRP in the first market (AUD) and then sells the XRP in the new market (USD). This lowers the cost of the transaction, increases the speed and reduces the risk of holding some currencies.\n\nxVia, this software is what brings it all together. XVia acts like a plugin on chrome. All you have to do is install it. The Chrome interface is the same and you didn\u2019t have to retrain or learn anything new, but you have the added functionality.\n\nToday, Ripples\u2019 Global Head of Strategic Accounts Marcus Treacher announced that Ripple has signed over 100 production contracts. Meaning that over 100 Banks/finical institutions are or will use Ripple technology. Some customers include MUFG, Santander, Westpac & American Express.\n\nEarlier this year Ripples CTO left and founded Coil. Coil pays content creators like Youtubers, Authors and Bloggers for the time people spend viewing the content. Right now, it is hard to for independent content creators to earn an income from their work, but coil solves this. Coil uses XRP to pay content creators as regular payment solutions would make it uneconomical.\n\nThe programs that use XRP (xRapid and Coil) haven\u2019t been launched yet but are expected to later this year Q3 \u2013 Q4.\n\nOn October 1st, 2018 Ripple is hosting an event called Swell and it \u201cbrings together leaders in banking and blockchain who are committed to changing the way the world moves money today\u201d.\n\nSwell is going to be MASSIVE.\n\nHere are some of the key speakers at Swell (an event run by, and about Ripple)\n\n\u2022 President Bill Clinton\n\n\u2022 Gene Sperling\n\n\u00b7 National Economic Council Director and National Economic Advisor\n\n\u00b7 (1996-2001, 2011-2014\n\n\u2022 Ed Metzger\n\n\u00b7 Head of Innovation at Banco Santander\n\n\u00a7 \uf0a7 Banco Santander is the ninth-largest financial service company\n\n\u2022 Richard Teng\n\n\u2022 CEO of Abu Dhabi Global Markets\n\nThose are just the people speaking the event is going to be packed with the world\u2019s wealthiest and influential people in the financial sector.\n\nSo why do I care about this?\n\nThe price of XRP like most assets is determined by demand. When more people want it, the price goes up. During the last Cryptocurrency explosion, Ripple reached above $3 per XRP if someone had bought 1000 XRP for $300 they would have made a profit of around $2700.\n\n$2700 is a lot of money but why didn\u2019t it go higher?\n\nHere are 3 reasons\n\nReason 1: There wasn\u2019t enough liquidity in the market. There simply weren\u2019t enough platforms that allowed users to buy and sell. Brokers had to close registrations because they couldn\u2019t handle the capacity.\n\nSince January 2018 dozens of trading platforms and wallets have been launched. (capital is not investing like that into collapsing markets)\n\nReason 2: The price of XRP has been/is tied to the price of Bitcoin. This is because Bitcoin has a 54% dominance over other cryptocurrencies. Meaning the market value of Bitcoin is 54% higher than the rest of the market combined. Therefore, when the sentiment of Bitcoin falls, and people sell (decreasing demand) the demand for XRP also falls.\n\nXRP is no longer \u2018just another cryptocurrency\u2019. This kind of innovation and implementation is unlike anything else in the space. XRP is about to completely blow up in value and it\u2019s only a matter of time.\n\nReason 3: There wasn\u2019t a strong proof of concept. The technology was their but no one new how it was going to be used or what to do with it. People wanted to buy XRP for the value, but there was no value without utilisation of the coin.\n\nThis is solved with the development of xRapid and Coil.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t give you investment advice because nothing is a guarantee and the price of XRP could go to 0 but if you want to know anything more about it or want help investing let me know. It\u2019s impossible to predict how high the price of XRP is going to go but predictions range anywhere from $8 to $589 but most point to a \\~$50 price.\n\nIf you invested $100 and the price went to\n\n\u2022 $8 \\~ $2600\n\n\u2022 $50 \\~ $16 600\n\n\u2022 $580 \\~ $193 300\n\nIf you invest $500 and the price went to\n\n\u2022 $8 \\~ $13 300\n\n\u2022 $50 \\~ $83 300\n\n\u2022 $580 \\~ $966 600\n\nWould this be good to send to my parents? They know about Ripple from the appearance on Ellen so I decided to follow up and educated them on it. How many of you are trying to spread the word?\n\nEdit:\n\n1. Ripple didn\u2019t make XRP... that\u2019s embarrassing. It\u2019s strange how much of the XRP community believes that they did.\n2. Price predictions are dumb ",

        "post_body": "Long time lurker, I'm currently living in the US and I've been using Stellar to send money to my family in the Philippines for over a year. They've been using Abra to cash out, however, I believe they recently got flagged for KYC and it's been a massive pain to get all the documents together, we're still working on it, but I need to find a new system to send to them for the time being while they get that approved. \n\nI would really appreciate any recommendations. I'm not looking forward to using a service like Western Union. \n\nSide Note: Stellar has saved me so much money by sending via that method vs a service like Western Union and it's sooo fast. I've loved it, I've been investing in it since 2017 and using it this way has only made me appreciate the project more. My mother in-law who has never once invested in her life is now investing little by little into Stellar and it's been really eye opening and has only re-assured me as to why Stellar has always been my favorite crypto. Banking the unbanked is such a massive need in this world, we just need more convenient on/off ramps.\n\nEdit: Thankfully my family members were able to complete KYC with Abra. I was able to get one friend to try out Binance -> GCash. While I love binance, it definitely doesn\u2019t have the best user interface. To cash out on Binance, they had to use the P2P network which just makes you feel like your going to get scammed somehow. \n\nFor larger amounts, we\u2019ll most likely end up using Finance P2P with verified accounts (I believe the transaction fee is lower, I still need to truly test this out and will once I move back). However for most people, Abra is far more friendly to use.",

        "post_body": "#6 crucial things I learned in 2017.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAs I find it difficult to share this story with friends and family so I turn to this community. They either don\u2019t understand or think everything that sounds like crypto is a bubble.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAlso I hope that this story might help others to avoid the mistakes I made.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**TLDR:**\n* **I fundamentally believe in XRP and ~10x\u2019ed my FIAT so far (compared to $),**\n* **Could have 15x\u2019ed if I would have not have made emotional decisions based on greed, fomo and FUD,**\n* **Make rules for yourself and stick to them. Period,**\n* **I will buy XRP till $5,**\n* **Bitstamp is a great exchange but at some point definitely secure your holdings with some level of paranoia.**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nThis story is about my personal journey on the XRP train. A story about fundamental analysis, FOMO (fear of missing out), FUD (fear uncertainty and doubt), my greed, emotional trading, belief in XRP and patience.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nMy journey started with bitcoin actually in ~ 2013. I had this friend who kept talking about this bitcoin that will change the world.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIt was around $600 at the time, I told him he was crazy and it was a bubble, without even researching it I waved his words away.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe higher BTC rose, the more effort I made to tell him it was a bubble and it would crash. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nAt some point it did, after reaching ~1200 or so. Major crash.\n\nI was right!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIn ~ 2014 I had to buy a few BTC to perform a transaction on a infamous dark web market place that is no longer.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAfter that, I forgot about bitcoin and crypto currencies\u2026.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFast forward to January 2017. Crypto is on my radar again, it\u2019s still there\u2026\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI start reading and following the rapid growth of BTC until April 2017. I don\u2019t understand BTC craze. Of course, it was the first, the tech is revolutionary but there are some problems for me;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n* High transaction fees, </br>\n* Centralised mining power,\n* No immediate real world use case,\n* Distribution graph of BTC wallet holdings favours a small percentage,\n* Incredibly bad for the environment.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAlso I found out about this \u2018other thing\u2019, XRP.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe more I read the more I believe in the fundamentals;\n\n* Ripple Labs, Inc. is venture backed by Google, Andreesen & Horrowitz, Accenture, SBI (USD 100M of funding);\n* Aiming to replace SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, founded in 1973!);\n* Ripple Labs, Inc\u2019s digital token XRP has transaction speeds of under 5 seconds and fees of less than a cent $;\n* Works together with banks in stead of against them.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI soon figure out this crucial part:\n\n>If banks adopt Ripple\u2019s software and later XRP as a bridge for international transfers they will likely need to purchase XRP to execute these transfers\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>If banks for example need to send $10 Billion, there needs to be sufficient liquidity in the XRP market for such a large USD amount to flow through XRP.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIn May 2017, XRP is 0.22 USD with a market cap of ~ 9 Billion USD. \n\n>How the hell will banks be able to send large amounts of FIAT through XRP without causing massive price swings?\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThey cannot. I figured that if banks were going to use XRP to send let\u2019s say USD 1 trillion on a daily basis XRPs unit price would need to be WAAAYY higher.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nLet\u2019s Imagine 75% of the coins is being held and not actively trading. 25% of the total supply is being traded on a daily basis. For 1 trillion USD to pass through that 25% should be at least valued at 1 Trillion USD. But likely higher because everyone involved in this want a stable price.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI thought that if Ripple succeeds and banks adopt Ripple\u2019s software, it is likely that Ripple will convince banks to use XRP as well.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBetting on Ripple the company I believed that XRP was massively undervalued at .22 USD, especially in comparison with coins such as BTC, LTC and some others.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAfter reading up on Ripple and XRP for 2 months straight I decided to buy in for 20% of my net worth (yes, huge gamble and not recommended).\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI buy Bitcoin at a local broker with a ~4% spread and send the BTC to Bitstamp. Upon arrival on Bitstamp a few hours later I realise that some of my BTC is missing. High transaction fees and a relatively big spread between the broker\u2019s price and the price on bitstamp I find out later.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI told myself to hold XRP for 5 years.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis is how my journey goes after that:\n\n* End of may 2017, purchased XRP at .22$,\n* Two weeks later: sending 50% of XRP to another exchange and FOMO it into ETH,\n* End of August I panic sell my ETH for FIAT with a 30% loss, I invested more than I could afford to lose at that time,\n* Between August and October FUD hits me, this coin is going nowhere. I even accomplish to forget about crypto for a few weeks.\n* October 18, I FOMO into XRP again during SWELL and tripple my holdings at .27$,\n* Dec 6,  XRP is going nowhere still, was I wrong? Everything rises but not us.. \n* I read on Reddit that diversifying is good and I plan on spreading my crypto holdings (ETH, NEO, XBR, ADA and IOTA) \n* I send 10% of my XRP to another exchange to buy ADA at .09$,\n* I send 10% of my XRP to another exchange to buy IOTA  (FOMO) at 3.5$\n* Within a few days I sell my IOTA at 4.27$ and leave that particular exchange, it\u2019s a shitty exchange,\n* Dec 13, I get greedy with my XRP profit and sell at .38$, hoping to buy back lower,\n* Dec 13, price rises and I FOMO and buy back XRP at .39$,\n* Dec 14, I increase my XRP holding by 50% coming from FIAT,\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAt this point I am still high in profits (could be more if I did not sell though..)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n* Dec 14, ADA moons.\n* Dec 14, XRP rises further, I feel incredibly smart and get greedy. I will now day trade and make even more gains. I think it will correct and sell 30% of my holdings at .65$, I will buy back lower I think,\n* Dec 14, XRP rises further and I am FOMO again, buy back the 30% at .78$,\n* I feel so stupid,\n* Dec 17, I sell ADA for BTC at ATH of .55$, I am so smart,\n* I convert it all back to XRP,\n* Dec 21, greed hits again and I want to buy back lower after the correction. I sell 20% at .92$ and place by orders at .80$,\n* Dec 22, XRP moons and I FOMO once more, I buy back at 1.24$,\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAs of now I feel very happy with 10x gains on the total FIAT amount I put in.\nHowever I also feel stupid for not sticking to my plan of holding XRP for 5 years without trading.\nIf I had stuck to my plan I would have been up 15x by now.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMy new plan:\n\n* I toke all my XRPs offline and stored it very securely with tin-hat + hyper paranoia mentality,\n* Increase my XRP holdings and buy with FIAT until $5 and diversify my storage into multiple places/ledgers,\n* At $10, cash out all FIAT investments I made, all the paper profit and loss is on the house from now on,\n* Hold my XRP at least till end of 2020, all or nothing.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI learned some things:\n\n* Make your own plan and stick to it,\n* Consider all your investment in XRP or any other crypto to be lost,\n* NEVER EVER make any financial decision when you emotional (panic, euphoric, greedy, etc..),\n* If you believe in the fundamentals of XRP just hold, be patient,\n* If you are not a trader by profession don\u2019t think you will be a good crypto trader after reading some stuff online, it is very unlikely that you will be able to time the market, you might make some profits in the short run for sure but the stress and emotion is real and you\u2019re basically just gambling even more than when you are only holding (that\u2019s already enough of a gamble),\n* Reflect on your own behaviour once in a while, what caused you to buy/sell?\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHopefully this story might be of some use.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTo all /r/Ripple'ers, big thanks; especially to those answering questions from newcomers and to those keeping thus sub high quality and free of memes and other low quality posts.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWishing everyone a great start of 2018 and **happy holding!**\n",

I'm made in Korea, living in Australia :p\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nKorean Exchanges and Banks (Requiring accounts to be verified)\n\n&nbsp;\nKorean investors can only trade from exchange that is linked to their banks.. For example\n\n\nKorbit exchange - Shinhan bank only\n\n\nCoinone exchange - Nong hyup bank only\n\n\nUpbit exchange - Gi-up bank only\n\n\nBithumb exchange - Nong hyup, Shinhan bank \netc etc\n\n&nbsp;\n\nGovernment and Banks\n\n&nbsp;\nGovernment (recently revealed that they are heavily invested in cypto), want Banks to be held accountable for should there be any problems with crypto. i.e. Even hacking of the exchange sites... So it is Up to banks to decision, not exchanges.\n\nNow I can't confirm if above bill was passed or not (probably won't) but seems like Government wants to intimidate & manipulate Banks while not officially announcing the ban. Because IF Government bans crypto, come next election and they'll be out on the streets.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nKorean Exchanges that doesn't require account verification\n\n&nbsp;\n(So something like Binance where no / minimal verification is in place)\nIf these exchanges fail up signing contract with banks, they will closed. full stop.\nWill Banks signup with them? Probably No. As they are minor exchanges and again, Banks are to be responsible. Such a BS.\n\n\n\n\nHad my relative who tried to create a bank account to use in Exchanges but failed.

        "post_body": "&#x200B;\n\nThere are several reasons I believe Stellar is the network that ends up ruling the 80$ trillion CBDC market .\n\n>According to the *CIA*, the total amount is $80 *trillion* if you include \"broad money.\"\n\n[https://www.businessinsider.com/heres-how-much-money-there-is-in-the-world-2017-10?r=US&IR=T](https://www.businessinsider.com/heres-how-much-money-there-is-in-the-world-2017-10?r=US&IR=T)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>\u201cCBDCs was exactly the type of digital money Stellar was designed for,\u201d said Stellar CEO Denelle Dixon, at a recent blockchain conference.\n\n[https://forkast.news/digital-currency-cbdc-bitcoin-kevin-kelly-delphi-digital-podcast/](https://forkast.news/digital-currency-cbdc-bitcoin-kevin-kelly-delphi-digital-podcast/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Issuer Enforced Finality**\n\n[https://www.stellar.org/blog/issuer-enforced-finality-explained?locale=en](https://www.stellar.org/blog/issuer-enforced-finality-explained?locale=en)\n\nDo not underestimate this one, basically central banks don't want to end up in a classic ethereum, and ethereum, or a bitcoin, bitcoin cash, bitcoin gold, ... kind of situation. Central banks think it's super uncool to have to deal with USD Gold, USD Cash, and so forth. So we can likely exclude all DLT's that don't have the possibility of **issuer enforced finality.**  A large win for Stellar\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Interoperability**\n\nStellar makes it very easy to create, send and trade digital representations of all forms of money and convert between them on a single network, this will eventually be the way to convert money and all kinds of assets currency, stocks, gold, and so forth.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Public and non-profit**\n\nIf you think Central Banks are going to issue their CBDC's where the foundation taking care of the network is for profit, think again. Here again Stellar aim for the stars and hits. I'd count many of the for profit initiatives as unlikely to get any CBCD's released on them\n\n>'Stellar has no owner; if anything it\u2019s owned by the public. The software runs across a decentralized, open network ...'\n\n[https://www.stellar.org/learn/intro-to-stellar](https://www.stellar.org/learn/intro-to-stellar)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>\u201cI left Ripple in 2013. They didn\u2019t take it into the right direction. What we wanted to improve is the way that the tokens are distributed. They also set it up as a for profit company. Can you imagine the internet as a for profit? it\u2019s a mistake. So, Stellar was set up as a nonprofit...\"\n\nJed McCaleb\n\n[https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/stellar-ceo-want-real-enough-dot-com-bubble-pops/](https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/stellar-ceo-want-real-enough-dot-com-bubble-pops/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Extremely cheap, fast transfer costs and scale**\n\nWith bitcoin transactions costing an arm and a leg, Stellar shines like starlight yet again.\n\nEven if xlm is to go up to 15USD which I think it will over the next 4-5 years. Given it gets 5-6 CBDC's on the network in that time. The transaction cost will still be close to nothing. And with price surging we have a solution to 'spam' on the networks. It already handles millions of transactions/operations each day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Massive CDBC' Market & Metcalfes law**\n\nSeveral countries are starting to move into or seriously consider CBDC's, and this will make the network extremely valuable over time. Not valuable because it's valuable, but valuable because it is extremely useful to people. Usefulness comes first and then value, and value and price are not the same. This is very easy to forget in todays crypto market.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>\u201cStellar is an open protocol for payments. If there\u2019s a digital dollar, there needs to be a real one somewhere. That\u2019s what Stellar does. We have a Stellar consensus protocol. BTC uses proof of work. It\u2019s an extremely expensive process. We have a way more efficient system. Not everybody has to agree on who you trust on the network.>>The creators of the internet didn\u2019t predict Wikipedia or airBNB. And that\u2019s what we are. We\u2019re a platform that allows a lot of creativity and enormous opportunities.\u201d\n\n*Jed McCaleb*\n\n[https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/stellar-ceo-want-real-enough-dot-com-bubble-pops/](https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/stellar-ceo-want-real-enough-dot-com-bubble-pops/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Energi Efficiency**\n\nIn the world many people and governments are concerned with energy usage, and since Stellar is not a proof of work network, it is much, much more energy efficient. This matters and is likely to matter even more in the future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>\u201cBut software is iterative and can always be improved. One of the things that bothered me about Bitcoin is the mining aspect. There are literally billions of dollars spent on mining which is a shame. I thought if there is another way we can solve the consensus problem, then we should explore it. So with Ripple and now Stellar, this is a way to solve consensus without the proof-of-work mining process so transactions can be sent in a much cheaper, faster, more energy-efficient way.\"\n\nJed McCaleb\n\n[https://bravenewcoin.com/insights/podcasts/connect-the-world-how-stellar-is-connecting-the-global-financial-system](https://bravenewcoin.com/insights/podcasts/connect-the-world-how-stellar-is-connecting-the-global-financial-system)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUkraine:\n\n[https://stellar.org/press-releases/ukrainian-ministry-of-digital-transformation-to-develop-virtual-assets-and-to-facilitate-cbdc-infrastructure-with-the-stellar-development-foundation](https://stellar.org/press-releases/ukrainian-ministry-of-digital-transformation-to-develop-virtual-assets-and-to-facilitate-cbdc-infrastructure-with-the-stellar-development-foundation)\n\nSweden:\n\nTheir e-currency pilot project is completing February this year.

Instead of TRONIX fixing this, they deleted everything and kept quiet. This is not only a dumb move, it's also what a scammer would do. Tronix obviously isn't a scam, but that's exactly how a scam would behave.\n\n- People are laughing their asses off at Justin's tweets and twitter.

        "post_body": "All the projects planning airdrops on EOS *must* read this.\n\nEOSdac just completed its airdrop in a 1:1 manner for EOS tokens. The result? A several hundred million dollar market cap. Out of thin air. In a few days. At the same moment, by keeping some tokens to themselves, the team self-funded.\n\nThis demonstrates the immensely innovative economic model of EOS that essentially no one has caught onto yet. EOS is going to move us away from the insane ICO model that people have been doing on Ethereum for so long. It leads to poor distributions as people try to get in early and then sell for 10x on the market later. And also it leads to trouble as these ICOs are investments and the SEC will certainly be interested in them.\n\nSo now we see how simple and effective the path forward is to self fund your project on EOS. If you want funding for your project on EOS, here is what you do. You don't have to do KYC, have people sign up, do bounties, or anything else. Tell people about it, have a presence, make a website. Announce a countdown. But that's it. And then just airdrop the damn tokens. Bomb the chain in a 1:1 manner. Keep 10% or so for yourself as a bounty. BOOM. You just made a market and now own a significant chunk. If your project is any good it will be held onto by the token holders and have a high price. If your project is terrible it will be valued lower. But probably it will be valued in the tens of millions at minimum, and if you have any potential at all, possibly even the hundreds of millions. Therefore, the projects will find natural market caps. The more you succeed the bigger your share will grow.\n\nEOSdac just *proved* you could make a market out of thin air by letting the EOS distribution list hold onto tokens, evaluate the project, and then buy or sell dependent on whether they like the project.\n\nSo forget doing an ICO. There is no ICO. Just an airdrop. Which means there are no security laws. There are no contributions or list of contributors to worry about. There is nothing. You are just distributing some \"worthless\" tokens free of charge to a distribution of addresses. It's not an investment and you don't need to worry about the SEC. No one does. If people then *want* to make a market (oh and believe me they will if your project is good) they do that of their own accord. Note that this mimics exactly what block.one did with EOS, by distributing the tokens and then letting *others* start the chain. You distribute your tokens, don't price them or sell them yourself, and let *others* make the market. You then own a nice little chunk of that market. \n\nSo forget about KYC, forget about collecting emails, forget all that. Forget about the SEC and security laws too. Just drop the tokens, keep a bit for yourself, and let the market sort it out. The EOSdac experiment proves this would be an extremely lucrative, simple, and legally viable way of self-funding your project.",

Few weeks ago, I made a BNB transaction from trust wallet to binance and forgot to include the correct MEMO ID due to which I did not get my funds to show up at binance. So I had raised a ticket with binance and never heard back. I got frustrated with their lack of response for a long time and sent a message to binance on Twitter saying that they are not responding to my ticket and still did not get a response. On that note, I got an message from one of the groups on Twitter saying that they are from trust wallet and they can help me with this issue. I was sure a fool and believed that they are truly from trust wallet and I did whatever they asked me to do in hopes to recover back my incorrect BNB transaction. I gave them access to my wallet like an idiot by sharing the secret key that they asked me to do and they swiped my wallet clean and left zero balance. I lost a $5,000 worth of coins and one of those coins is 16x today from the time I purchased. So they swiped close to $80,000 from my wallet including the profits I could have made. \n\nThis leads me to think, there must be so many innocent and naive people like me out there. Have any of you faced such an situation ?. Please do NOT do the mistake I did. While this was such an frustrating situation for me to come in terms with, I learnt a valuable lesson for life which I will take with me until I die. I want everyone who is innocent or rather naive and stupid like me to learn from my horrible experience. The feeling is horrendous. I can\u2019t believe that I lost close to $80,000 in a jiffy. Please learn from my experience and never do such a thing I did. Please share your experience if you have any. \n\nLastly I want to combat these brats who claim to be TrustWallet and the ones who steal crypto from wallets. How do we do that ?.

Look at /r/bitcoin, /r/btc, /r/litecoinmarket, and other similar subs to tell you what to expect. This sub will be swamped with memes, hundreds of posts on small price fluctuations, downvote brigading of ANY discussion of the tech because any tech discussion necessarily requires self-criticism of the product. \n\nThis is inevitable. Perhaps we can't avoid the incoming scourge, but we can mitigate it. As early adopters, don't just upvote nice posts. Actively DOWNVOTE posts that treat Stellar as a get-rich-quick-scheme. Downvote stupid memes and stupid price posts. \n\nEdit: My prescription for any mods listening is that we ban all posts related to price or memes. Already the top three posts are about prices.

The lifeblood of most Digital Assets are their Blockchains, and as we have seen with other cryptocurrencies the biggest threat is a 51% attack. What if a blockchain exists where there is ZERO chance of a 51% attack; where the miners all do what is best for the project, and improve the reputation of the cryptocurrency by ensuring criminals will never choose to use it. Electroneum\u2019s Moderated Blockchain accomplishes precisely this. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7cds6v7kbz831.jpg?width=1573&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7d25da6109afb65165dc03fdaa735a4aea442921\n\n**System Upgrade and Improvements**\n\n\u00b7 **Public Blockchains Risk 51% Attacks**\n\n\u00b7 **Moderated Blockchain Has ZERO Chance of 51% Attacks**\n\n\u00b7 **Maintained by Multiple Trusted Organizations** \n\n\u00b7 **Many Benefits\u2026**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you take a look at public blockchains, the danger exists of a rogue entity taking control in a 51% attack, but this is not possible in a Moderated Blockchain because multiple trusted organizations, such as NGOs and other approved entities, maintain the network for their own benefit as well as that of that of the network.Working together, without having to be aware of one another, the benefits of this type of decentralization are many.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qsnmcs9mbz831.jpg?width=2228&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=acc98d86c1892b98b480a324bcc1f466a72de84d\n\n**Network Control**\n\n\u00b7 **ZERO Chance of a 51% Attack**\n\n\u00b7 **Unique Mining Authentication Codes Issued by Electroneum**\n\n\u00b7 **Each Miner is a Trusted Entity**\n\n\u00b7 **No Single Miner Can Apply Two Blocks in a Row**\n\n\u00b7 **Immediate Action Network Fail-Safes:**\n\n\u00b7 **Remotely Throttle the Hashing Rate**\n\n\u00b7 **Completely Revoke Authentication Keys from Mining**\n\nUtilizing a closed source mining codebase, Electroneum\u2019s Moderated Blockchain makes for ZERO chance of a 51% attack because each miner must obtain a unique mining authentication code directly from the Electroneum Team, *and* no single miner can apply two blocks in a row. In the realm of What If\u2019s \u2013 let\u2019s say in the unlikely event of a network compromise where both the Authentication Code *and* the mining software are compromised \u2013 the Electroneum Team can remotely throttle the hashing rate or completely revoke Authentication Keys immediately from mining access. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dads0tdqbz831.jpg?width=2125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=63969f99c5f6b757ac6353a22b107afae1f8aec8\n\n**Network Security and Integrity**\n\n\u00b7 **Public Blockchain Vulnerabilities Appeal to Criminals**\n\n\u00b7 **ETN First Cryptocurrency with Mandatory KYC and AML Checks**\n\n\u00b7 **Moderated Blockchain Model Takes This to Another Level**\n\n\u00b7 **Known Originators of Every Block**\n\n\u00b7 **Electroneum\u2019s Commitment:** \n\n\u00b7 **Improve Reputation of Cryptocurrency**\n\n\u00b7 **Ensure Criminals Never Choose ETN**\n\nPublic blockchains very often appeal to criminals because they are so vulnerable. Electroneum was first to introduce mandatory KYC and AML checks. The Moderated Blockchain model takes this to another level by knowing who the originators are of every block. In its commitment to improving the reputation of cryptocurrency, Electroneum wants to ensure criminals will never choose to use ETN.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xznfubzrbz831.jpg?width=2228&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6a8b2f94ba55298dcf8763e8ce2a39950534ddb0\n\n**Lower Transaction Fees**\n\n\u00b7 **Electroneum\u2019s Priority of Low Fees**\n\n\u00b7 **Less Data Redundancy**\n\n\u00b7 **Simplified Data Handling**\n\n\u00b7 **Reduced Transaction Fees**\n\n\u00b7 **ZERO Risk of Being \u201cHeld to Ransom\u201d**\n\n\u00b7 **All Transactions are Processed, No Matter How Small the Fee**\n\nKeeping mining fees very low, to an absolute minimum, has always been a priority for Electroneum. The Moderated Blockchain has less data redundancy and simplifies data handling \u2013 what this means is reduced transaction fees and an assurance that, unlike public blockchains, Electroneum\u2019s will never be held to ransom. With the Moderated blockchain all transactions are processed no matter how small the fee miners will *not* be able to mine empty blocks while refusing low fee transactions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6qp5kfysbz831.jpg?width=2228&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2769084a2dd9aaf2311a65c1a10a3dcfe1556d96\n\n**Supreme Scalability**\n\n\u00b7 **Anti-Spam Transaction System**\n\n\u00b7 **Moderated Blockchain Eliminates \u201cBlockchain Stuffing\u201d**\n\n\u00b7 **Removes Vectors of Attack**\n\n\u00b7 **Further Reduces Fees**\n\n\u00b7 **Supreme Scalability**\n\nFor scalability, the Moderated blockchain provides Electroneum the ability to implement an Anti-Spam transaction system, effectively putting an end to \u201cblockchain stuffing\u201d or filling the blockchain with nonsense and spam transactions. By removing these vectors of attack Electroneum\u2019s blockchain further reduces fees, and the speeds increase, including utilization of Electroneum\u2019s Instant Payment Technology. This is a blockchain with Supreme Scalability.\n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k45itydubz831.jpg?width=2228&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=06cf9489b5e20b34ea295e3cb7f72be2147cfc36\n\n**Faster Network Consensus Speed**\n\n\u00b7 **Public Blockchains Network Consensus** \n\n\u00b7 **Time Consuming**\n\n\u00b7 **Drags on Performance**\n\n\u00b7 **Electroneum\u2019s Moderated Blockchain:**\n\n\u00b7 **Maintains 10 Minute Consensus Model**\n\n\u00b7 **5 Blocks**\n\n\u00b7 **Easily Reduced Further, If Needed**\n\nPublic Blockchain applications require considerable time to validate and agree on transactions, known as a network consensus, and it constantly drags on their performance. Electroneum\u2019s Moderated Blockchain maintains a simple 10 minute consensus model of just 5 blocks, and can reduce that further if needed in future forks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Electroneum Moderated Blockchain Ecosystem**\n\nElectroneum has set a new standard, establishing the first Moderated Blockchain. By utilizing a redundant array of highly trusted nodes to moderate the decentralized node layer of the blockchain, and ensure there is no untoward activity, this Proof of Responsibility model sets a new uncompromising level of performance and security. \n\nOperating under multiple trusted authorities working together to validate blocks, Electroneum\u2019s Moderated Blockchain is an extremely efficient, secure, and complete ecosystem.",

There are so many potential problems with the conversion and the value is almost certainly going to stay level or even go down when the bad news of conversion problems starts surfacing on forums. So to wait and buy directly after main net would be the safest bet and probably yield a discount on pricing.\nIF the price of trx does moon, and stay up, it will be after main net. "

It was definitely a bumpy start with whales and bots buying up a lot of the coin after a soft launch and there being a dump by them from an all-time high market cap of $2.5 million. The community rebuilt from a lowly market cap of $7k as nothing had really changed but a few bad actors spreading FUD and the community has gone from strength to strength with the developers consistently surprising us by listening to our ideas and suggestions. I have been constantly adding to my amount after buying in a small amount when the token first took off and I personally see a big future. I am really excited about what the future holds for S W and it is evident from the people in the community that they really want it to grow and prosper. It still feels so early and at times feels like the best kept secret in crypto for me with only a market cap of $230k and holders at 2100. I regularly see meme coins with no utility or serious intentions hit market caps in the millions. It definitely has taken patience with this coin and mental steel holding through jumps to $600k + twice from coin gecko listing and other catalysts but what was promising to see was almost all the top wallets haven\u2019t sold \u00a0throughout and are if anything adding.\n\u00a0\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLong term there are plans such as:\n\u00a0\n+ Community decided purchases\n+ Building own exchange\n+ Social platform\nYou can read them in more detail on the website.\n\u00a0\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nUSEFUL LINKS FOR NEW HOLDERS\n\u00a0\nhttps://smartworth.org/\n\u00a0\nTG: @ smartworthglobal\n\u00a0\nr/smartworth\n\u00a0\nContract address: 0xd50787a5f21bcc10c1a738e7de33001786c5fc24\n\u00a0\nV2 Pancake swap & Slippage 5%\n\u00a0\nChart:\nhttps://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/smartworth\n\u00a0\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",

        "post_body": "The TRON Community Node Project (v. 2.0 - TGNT token removed)\n\n\nOn May 31, 2018, Tron Labs will launch the Main Net and thus transition the TRX cryptocurrency away from the Ethereum blockchain to one managed by Tron Labs. Beginning On June 25th, the TRX coinholders will vote in daily elections to choose 27 organizations to run their blockchain network. These organizations will become Super Representatives who operate computer servers called 'nodes.'\n\nTron Labs will pay these nodes 32 TRX coins for every block of data produced. The 27 nodes will take turns creating these blocks at the rate of 1 per second, or about 2 blocks each per minute.\n\nThat's a little more than 2,750,000 TRX per day at an average of about 100,000 TRX per Super Representative.\n\nThe Super Representatives will earn TRX daily, but in order to maintain elected power those Super Representatives must provide benefits to the TRX voters who elected them. In addition to benefitting the Tron community with support initiatives, a Super Representative may wish to share its rewards directly with the TRX voters who elect it every day. \n\nI am already running a cloud based node on the test net, with a focus on uptime and reliability. I hope to meet the performance levels sufficient to get my node voted into the group of candidates for Super Representative, after which the node may or may not enter rotation as an earning Super Representative. \n\nOriginally I had welcomed the notion of taking a seat at the table next to other members of the TRON community, then I realized there probably won't be room for even one of us. \n\nAnd then I wondered, \n>'Since a TRON Network Super Representative is actually a collection of people backed by an organization, what if the members of the Reddit, Twitter, and YouTube community banded together to become a Super Representative?' \n\nThere won't be a seat at the table for any one of us, but perhaps there's one for all of us. Alone we each stand zero chance of winning an election, but together we can vote ourselves in.\n\nThis is not a novel idea. Several other groups have formed with similar intentions, with different rewards plans being developed. Anticipating this, I have set this project apart from the others by proposing an **open source** structure for the management and ownership of the organization.\n\nTo run a Super Representative node, the Tron Foundation recommends a technical budget of $40,000 per month - a substantial investment for a startup. I have devised a plan to bootstrap our operation and to start I am paying out of pocket for the server's introductory level operation.  I have a plan to scale the server size according to its growing predominance, and have already increased the provisioning twice. If elected to one of these exclusive Super Representative posts I will be able to scale up what I believe will be a reasonably acceptable server instance within 10 minutes.\n\nThis will be my test for viability of the server.  If it succeeds, then we get to move on to the next phase of the plan. If it is woefully inadequate and fails to produce blocks when given the chance, then I will have lost a small sum and a considerable amount of time.\n\nIf the node is successful in earning block rewards, we will implement a voter rewards program. Please take a moment to review our [Rewards Proposal](https://github.com/bondibox/community-node/blob/master/doc/rewards_plan.md).\n\nIn a nutshell, while some Super Representatives will choose to reward the voters who elected them, we will create a market for buying votes.\n\nThe organization will have several responsibilities, both social and financial. Primarily it must maintain a reliable Full Node on the TRON blockchain. After core expenses are met, the community has several long-term considerations. \n\nThe Tron ecosystem will rely on application developers to create a need for TRX coins. Without applications, our investment in TRX will languish and become worthless. As partners in the Tron foundation, a Super Representative must be proactive in developing the Tron community through advocacy, advertisement, and applications. Spending money on these initiatives is not altruism, it is a self-serving gesture for the benefit of all TRX coinholders. We will prioritize the development of these initiatives in the early days of Tron main net so as to drive excitement and public awareness for the project.\n\nAfter these responsibilities have been met, we can open our treasury to the voters who make it possible for us to continue operations, sending them TRX rewards as a dividend for their participation.\n\nOur Mission is to become an intellectual asset for the community. The Tron project itself is open source, and we expect other cryptocurrencies to use the Tron application as a starting point for their blockchain networks. Other Distributed Proof of Stake cryptocurrencies may adopt Tron's Super Representative structure, and those Super Representatives will be creating organizations very similar to ours.\n\nWe chose to make our project Open Source in order to provide a resource for those who come after us. We are indeed pioneers in a brave new world and many will follow in our footsteps. Let us light their way.\n\nYou are encouraged to join us and become a part of our group. It's people just like you who we want to include in this effort.
